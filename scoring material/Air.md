Design Title: Commercial Direct Air Capture Pilot Award

Overview

U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management launches“Made in the USA Commercial Direct Air Capture (DAC) Pilot Award”. The award is designed to support the construction of multiple first-of-its-kind direct air capture pilot systems with minimum annual capture500tons of carbon dioxide. The competition is divided into four phases and aims to promote theseDACThe pilot project goes from design to construction and operation.

summary

To achieve net-zero global CO2 emissions, carbon capture must occur at the gigaton level, as outlined in the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.DOEof“Carbon Negative Tackling”Initiative works to find innovative carbon capture pathways, includingDACtechnology, the goal is to2032per ton per year below100USD cost to capture and store carbon dioxide. BusinessDACPilot awards are an important part of the initiative, with total awards amounting to5250million aimed at developing and commercializingDACtechnology.
