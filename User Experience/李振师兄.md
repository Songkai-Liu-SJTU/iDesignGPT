1\. \*\*Engineering Characteristics Ranking\*\*:  
   \- Sorted according to the "Total Engineering Characteristics Score", the order of scores from high to low is:  
     1\. Maximum load (140)  
     2\. Material selection (148)  
     3\. Sensor accuracy (116)

     9\. Budget constraints (44)  
     10\. Regulatory standards (9)

2\. \*\*Identify potential conflicts\*\*:  
   \- During the analysis, it was discovered that there may be a conflict between Maximum Load and Material Selection, as increasing material strength may increase weight, thus affecting maximum load performance.  
   \- In addition, there may be a conflict between "motor power" and "maximum speed". An increase in motor power may lead to an increase in speed, but it may also affect the stability of the system.  
   \- Recommendations for priority engineering properties to be achieved should start with "Material Selection" and "Maximum Loads", ensuring that materials are selected taking into account their effect on loads.

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition, the function block F11 (discharge waste lubricating oil) does not define the corresponding input material flow in the input flow, which results in the function block being incomplete with the overall process.  
2\. In the Mermaid diagram, the necessary material flow is missing between connection F6 (executing the test) and F11 (discharging the waste lubricating oil), and the source of the waste lubricating oil is not clearly indicated.  
3\. In the definition of input flow and output flow, the specific source and destination of the energy flow and material flow related to function block F6 (execution test) are not mentioned, resulting in unclear connections.  
4\. In the output part of the Mermaid diagram, the definition of E3 (waste lubricating oil) should be before F11 to clarify its source and flow direction.  
5\. It is necessary to ensure that the connections of all functional blocks comply with the functional black box diagram in \[Background\] to ensure the consistency of the input and output flows.

It is recommended that the functional structure be re-examined to ensure that each functional block has clear inputs and outputs, and that the sources and destinations of all flows are clearly represented in the Mermaid diagram.
