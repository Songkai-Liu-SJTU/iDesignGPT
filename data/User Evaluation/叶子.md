   \- Combined with AI algorithm and real-time monitoring technology, a closed-loop control system is developed to automatically adjust the adsorption and release process by analyzing the monitored charge amount to prevent excessive accumulation of static electricity.

5\. \*\*Based on material properties\*\*:  
   \- Use materials with high charge storage capacity and combine them with sensors to improve the accuracy and real-time performance of charge monitoring.

Through the above method, an efficient and accurate charge monitoring system can be constructed to ensure the stability and safety of the electrostatic adsorption grabbing device.

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. There are unreasonable connections between function blocks. According to the functional black box analysis, the connection between functions F2 (monitoring charge status to maintain equipment safety) and F3 (selecting materials to reduce static electricity risks) is not clear, and there is a lack of direct material flow or information flow connection description. It is recommended to clarify how charge monitoring affects Material selection.  
2\. In the input and output flow, E1 (adsorbed paper) and E2 (adsorption status feedback) are not clearly connected in the flow direction in the figure. It is recommended to ensure a clear logical relationship of the output flow.  
3\. In the function block, the connection between F5 (optimizing the adsorption process to improve efficiency) and F6 (providing status feedback to improve user experience) also needs to be further clarified, adding a description of how feedback information affects the optimization process.  
4\. The legend part cannot be effectively separated from the main picture part. It is recommended to clearly distinguish the Legend and Main parts in the picture to avoid confusion.  
5\. Please ensure that all input and output nodes (starting with B or E and arranged in numerical order) meet the format requirements and do not appear to be directly connected in the mermaid syntax.

\[Output\]  
\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition results, there are problems with the connection of material flow, information flow and energy flow. Specifically, the connection between F1 (which supplies power to provide electrical energy) and F2 (which monitors the state of charge to maintain device safety) lacks a clear energy flow and should indicate the flow of electrical energy.  
2\. In the input and output streams, E1 (adsorbed paper) and E2 (adsorption status feedback) do not have corresponding connections between the output stream and the function block, resulting in an inability to fully reflect the output of the function.  
3\. The connections between functional blocks do not fully show all flows. For example, F2 should be connected to F3 to clearly indicate how monitoring data affects material selection.  
4\. In the mermaid syntax, the format of the input and output nodes (such as B1, B2, B3, E1, E2) needs to be consistent with the functional structure diagram, and there should be a hidden and displayed format code at the end.  
5\. It is necessary to ensure that the descriptions of all functional blocks accurately correspond to the functional requirements in the design brief, especially the optimization of the adsorption process and the status feedback functions are not fully reflected.

Suggested changes:  
\- Add specific descriptions of energy flow, material flow and information flow to ensure that each functional block has clear input and output connections.  
\- Ensure that the connections between all nodes are logically complete and reflect the interaction between functions.  
\- Check and correct mermaid syntax to ensure that the format conforms to the standard and all input and output nodes have hidden format codes.

$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition diagram, although the definitions of basic functions and special functions are consistent with the descriptions in the design brief, the connections between all input and output flows are not clearly marked.  
2\. In the determination part of input and output, the specific contents of all energy flows, material flows and information flows are not specified in detail. For example, the specific nature of electrical energy, paper and charge monitoring data is not clearly stated.  
3\. The relationship between the input and output flows in the functional black box analysis and the functional structure decomposition diagram is not clear enough and cannot be completely corresponding.  
4\. In mermaid syntax, the connection of input and output nodes fails to fully reflect the complete process from input to output.  
5\. In the mermaid diagram, some nodes are not arranged in order and the format requirements are not strictly followed.  
6\. It is necessary to ensure that material flow, information flow and energy flow only contain nouns, and no behaviors or actions can appear.

It is recommended to describe the functional structure decomposition diagram in more detail, ensure that the connections and properties of all flows are clear, and strictly follow the format requirements of the mermaid diagram.
