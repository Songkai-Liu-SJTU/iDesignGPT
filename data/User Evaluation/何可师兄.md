$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition result, the description of the input stream and output stream is not completely consistent with the input and output of the functional black box diagram. It is necessary to ensure that all input and output streams in the functional diagram correspond to the input and output in the background.  
2\. In the connection between function blocks and flow directions, there are problems with direct connections between nodes, for example, the status of the flow is not clearly expressed.  
3\. When checking the node format, it was found that some nodes were not hidden and displayed according to the specified format, for example, format codes such as "style B1 fill:transparent,stroke:none" were missing.  
4\. It is necessary to ensure that the order and connection of all functional blocks are logical, and the flow direction between some functional blocks is not clear enough.  
5\. The naming of material flow, information flow, and energy flow should be more specific to ensure accurate description and avoid generalization.

It is recommended that the functional diagram be revisited to ensure that the type, path, and target module of each flow are accurate and consistent with standardized representations.

2\. The connection of functional blocks does not fully reflect the relationship between input streams, output streams and functional blocks, and some essential streams are missing.  
3\. In the mermaid syntax, the format of some nodes does not meet the requirements. For example, nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` are not arranged in numerical order.  
4\. There is confusion in the connection formats of material flow, information flow and energy flow, and some connections do not strictly follow the representation rules of energy flow, material flow and information flow.

\#\#\# 5\. Logical verification  
\- Confirm that the flow diagram accurately describes the functional structure of the friction testing machine, ensure that the type, path and target module of each flow direction are clear and clear, and the connections between functional blocks follow a logical sequence.

\[Output\]  
\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure, the connections between functional blocks are not entirely logical. For example, the connection between function 3 (temperature control) and function 4 (friction torque monitoring) lacks clear material flow or information flow support, but directly connects the two function blocks, which is illogical.  
2\. The description part of the input and output streams does not completely correspond to the flow direction of the functional blocks, resulting in no clear connection between the input and output streams of some functional blocks.  
3\. In the Mermaid diagram, the connections between the function blocks, input streams, and output streams are insufficient, and some necessary flow descriptions are missing, causing the integrity of the entire diagram to be affected.  
4\. The format of the input and output nodes is not marked strictly according to the requirements of "\[ \]", and some nodes lack the hidden display format code.

It is recommended to re-examine the relationship between functional blocks in the functional structure diagram to ensure that each functional block has a clear input and output flow and is logically connected. At the same time, check the Mermaid syntax to ensure the correctness and consistency of the format.

\#\#\# 5\. Logical verification  
The entire functional structure decomposition diagram has clear logic, the functional blocks are arranged reasonably, and the relationship between each input and output stream and the functional blocks is effectively reflected.  
\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition results, the description of the input flow and the output flow is not comprehensive enough. According to the design brief, the input flow should include electrical energy, cooling gas and friction torque data, while the output flow should include mechanical energy, real-time friction torque monitoring data and a stable temperature environment. It is necessary to ensure that these three inputs and three outputs are logically complete and clear.  
2\. There is a lack of clear flow direction in the connections between functional blocks. For example, the load application function (F4) is not clearly connected to other function blocks, resulting in insufficient logic.

\--Logic check failed\! \--

The reasons for rejection are:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition results, the description of the input flow and the output flow is not comprehensive enough. According to the design brief, the input flow should include electrical energy, cooling gas and friction torque data, while the output flow should include mechanical energy, real-time friction torque monitoring data and a stable temperature environment. It is necessary to ensure that these three inputs and three outputs are logically complete and clear.  
2\. There is a lack of clear flow direction in the connections between functional blocks. For example, the load application function (F4) is not clearly connected to other function blocks, resulting in insufficient logic.  
3\. In the connection of material flow, information flow and energy flow, the description of some flows is not accurate enough. For example, "temperature environment" should be described more specifically as "stable temperature environment" to ensure that the nature of the flow is accurately conveyed.  
4\. In the mermaid diagram, some nodes do not follow the format requirements. For example, the definitions of E1, E2, and E3 are not clear enough. Make sure that all nodes starting with B or E have the same format and contain hidden format codes.  
5\. In the connection state, there is a lack of necessary flow nouns, causing some connections to not meet logical requirements. Make sure that all connections point explicitly to the stream name.

In summary, the functional structure decomposition results are logically flawed and need to be modified to ensure their rationality and completeness.

For example, the flow of B1 should be described as "electrical energy" rather than directly labeled as "electrical energy".  
3\. In mermaid syntax, all nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and arranged in numerical order need to have a hidden display format code, but this is not fully followed in the current structure.

\--Merging modules \--  
In the process of analyzing and merging functional modules, we need to identify similar or repeated functional modules from the perspective of design and manufacturing, and reasonably divide the entire system into modules. The following is a module summary of the merged and finalized functional modules:

1\. \*\*Merge similar functions\*\*:  
   \- The "reciprocating rotation function" and the "load application function" can be combined into a "mechanical motion and loading module" because both involve the transmission and control of mechanical energy.  
   \- "Friction torque monitoring function" can be an independent module because it mainly involves signal processing and output.

2\. \*\*Add missing functions\*\*:  
   \- Add "Temperature Control Module": Supplement temperature control related functions from the design task book to ensure the control of the temperature environment.  
   \- Added "User Interface and Control Module": including user-friendly interface and remote monitoring and control functions.  
   \- Added "Safety Management Module": covering high temperature and high load safety and safety protection design.

3\. \*\*Module division and definition\*\*:  
   \- Mechanical motion and loading module  
   \- Temperature control module  
   \- Friction torque monitoring module  
   \- User interface and control module  
   \- Security management module

4\. \*\*Clear module functions\*\*:  
   \- Each module needs to have a clear functional definition to ensure that it can be directly mapped to specific technical implementation or hardware development.

5\. \*\*Determine input and output\*\*:  
   \- Each module should clarify its inputs and outputs, including material, energy and information flows.

6\. \*\*Engineering characteristics emphasized\*\*:  
   \- Ensure designs address real engineering challenges such as redundant design, security, scalability, etc.
