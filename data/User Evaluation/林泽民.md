2\. \*\*Identify potential conflicts\*\*:  
   \- When analyzing the QFD matrix, it was found that "security requirements" have a high correlation with other characteristics, especially with "industry standards and regulations", indicating that relevant standards need to be followed when optimizing security.  
   \- There is a high degree of correlation between "Pipeline Type Classification" and "Conflict Detection Accuracy". When optimizing, it is necessary to ensure that the accuracy of the classification will not affect the effect of conflict detection.  
   \- The correlation between other features is relatively low and there is less conflict.

3\. \*\*Optimization Suggestions\*\*:  
   \- Prioritize optimization of "safety requirements" to ensure that standards for fire-proof and leak-proof design are met.  
   \- Secondly, optimize the "pipeline type classification" to improve the recognition accuracy to better support subsequent conflict detection.  
   \- Next optimize the "Pipe Layout Path" and "Pipe Size" to maximize space utilization.  
   \- Finally, focus on the optimization of "bending angle" to reduce resistance.

\#\#\# Dynamic adjustment instructions

1\. \*\*Space utilization efficiency\*\*:  
   \- Since the customer's requirements clearly mention that space utilization optimization is a high-criticality requirement, and the pipeline layout path score in the engineering characteristics is high (65), its weight is increased to 0.20.

2\. \*\*Conflict detection accuracy and conflict resolution effectiveness\*\*:  
   \- Conflict detection and management is a high-criticality requirement for customers, and conflict detection accuracy has a high score (54) in engineering characteristics, so the weight of conflict detection accuracy is maintained at 0.20, and the weight of conflict resolution effectiveness is maintained at 0.15.

3\. \*\*Safety (fireproof, leakproof)\*\*:  
   \- Safety requirements have the highest score among engineering characteristics (91), and fire-proof and leak-proof design are high-critical requirements for customers, maintaining their weight of 0.15.

4\. \*\*Regulations and Standards Compliance\*\*:  
   \- Compliance with international and regional ship design standards is rated 49 in engineering characteristics, maintaining its weight of 0.10.

5\. \*\*Maintenance convenience\*\*:  
   \- Maintenance convenience is a medium-critical requirement among customer needs, and its weight is maintained at 0.10.

6\. \*\*Environmental Adaptability\*\*:  
   \- Environmental adaptability is a moderately critical requirement among customer needs, and its weight is maintained at 0.05.

7\. \*\*VERSATILITY\*\*:  
   \- Versatility is of low importance among customer needs, keeping its weight at 0.05.
