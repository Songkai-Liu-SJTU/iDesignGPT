\--Start updating evaluation criteria--  
\[Thought\]

When designing the final evaluation index system, I need to extract key elements from customer needs and engineering characteristics, and make dynamic adjustments based on their importance and priority. Here are my thoughts:

1\. \*\*Summary and integration\*\*:  
   \- \*\*Customer requirements\*\*: Battery life, fast charging, energy management systems, safety (regulatory requirements), intelligent driving systems and comfort are high-priority requirements. In addition, market positioning and innovative technologies also need to be considered.  
   \- \*\*Engineering Characteristics\*\*: Battery energy density, charging rate, aerodynamic coefficient, material strength and density, motor power, suspension system and other characteristics directly affect the realization of customer needs.

2\. \*\*Optimization and adjustment\*\*:  
   \- Initial weightings will be adjusted to reflect the priority of customer needs and the importance of engineering features. Make sure key requirements like battery life and fast charging are given a higher weight.  
   \- Keep indicators within 10 items and ensure that each indicator has clear quantitative standards.

3\. \*\*Customization and Application\*\*:  
   \- Dynamically adjust indicators and weights based on the particularities of the project (such as target market and level of technological innovation).  
   \- Ensure that the evaluation system can flexibly adapt to changes in design tasks.

Based on the above analysis, I will adjust and optimize the evaluation index system as follows:

\<Evaluation benchmark framework\>

| Lightweighting and Material Applications | Use lightweight materials to improve energy efficiency while ensuring safety and durability.                     | Material strength/density ratio, vehicle weight (kg) | 10% |  
| Safety and Regulatory Compliance | Ensure vehicles comply with international safety standards and regulatory requirements of target markets.                       | Compliance Score | 10% |  
| Aerodynamic design | Reduce wind resistance through innovative design while maintaining vehicle beauty and practicality.                   | Drag coefficient (Cd value) | 10% |

| Innovative technology application | Use innovative technologies (such as solid-state batteries, fast charging technology) to enhance product competitiveness.             | Number of technology applications and degree of innovation | 5% |  
\<Evaluation benchmark framework\>

This system ensures that key requirements and features are prioritized by redistributing weights and defining quantitative criteria, while having the flexibility to dynamically adjust to suit the needs of different design projects. ,,\# Product design brief

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition results, the connections between functional blocks fail to fully reflect the logical relationship between each functional block, and the input and output flows of some functional blocks are not clearly identified.  
2\. The connection between function blocks F4 (health monitoring) and F6 (entertainment system operation) in the main diagram is not clear, and there is a lack of clear output flow direction, resulting in an incomplete overall functional structure.  
3\. In the flow diagram, there are direct connections between nodes, such as "F2 \-- Electrical energy \--\> E1 \[Electric energy (driving electric motor)\]". It should be ensured that each flow direction passes through material flow, information flow or energy flow. stream to connect.  
4\. Regarding the format of the input and output nodes, the contents of E1, E2, and E3 do not fully comply with the regulations, and specific descriptions need to be added.  
5\. The naming of material flow, information flow and energy flow is not accurate enough. It is recommended to replace it with more specific nouns to improve readability and accuracy.  
6\. The Legend part and the Main part are not clearly separated, which may lead to rendering errors.

It is recommended to establish clearer connection relationships between functional blocks and ensure that each flow direction meets the format requirements to improve the completeness and logic of the functional structure.

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the connection between function blocks, some function blocks cannot be effectively connected. For example, the energy flow connection between F2 (charging system) and F1 (providing an electric driving experience for long distances) is unclear and does not show how the charging system directly affects the driving of the electric motor.  
2\. The connection between the health monitoring system (F4) and the electric driving experience (F1) fails to clearly show how the health monitoring data affects the driving experience or safety, and the information flow connection should be increased.  
3\. The connection between vehicle comfort optimization (F5) and electric driving experience (F1) also lacks a clear flow direction, failing to effectively demonstrate its impact on the driving experience.  
4\. In the description of the input and output flow, B3 (driver command) is directly connected to F3 (intelligent driving system), but it fails to show how the information flow feeds back to the driving experience or other functional blocks.  
5\. It is necessary to ensure that all nodes (starting with B and E) meet the format requirements, and the format code hidden and displayed in the mermaid diagram should be complete.  
6\. The Legend and Main diagrams need to be separated, and the Legend part should not appear in the Main diagram.

It is recommended to re-examine the connections between functional blocks to ensure that each functional block can be connected through an effective flow direction, and that the type of flow (energy, material, information) is consistent with the logic of the functional structure diagram.

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition results, the connections and flows between functional blocks do not completely follow logic. For example, the connection between function blocks F1 and F4 is described as "health monitoring data" and should be clearly identified as an information flow, but the type of flow cannot be clearly identified in the figure.  
2\. The material flow, information flow or energy flow contains behavioral descriptions. For example, "health monitoring data" should be the noun form of the flow and cannot contain behaviors.  
3\. The connections between nodes fail to fully reflect the types of all flows. There are direct connections without passing flow nouns. For example, "F1 \-- Electrical Energy \--\> E1" fails to clearly identify the specific type of flow.  
4\. All nodes starting with B or E cannot be arranged in the standard format in the figure, and the format code for hiding the display is missing.  
5\. There is a format error in the Mermaid syntax part and it fails to correctly render the types of flows, especially the identification of material flows and information flows.  
6\. The Legend part is mixed with the Main part and should be processed separately.

It is recommended to modify the functional structure decomposition results to ensure the logic of flow and compliance with various standards, so as to meet the passing standards. $Reason for rejection and modification comments$

$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure black box, the connections between nodes are not sufficient, and the types of some flows are not clearly marked. For example, the connection between energy flow and information flow is not clear enough, resulting in unclear implementation paths for functions.  
2\. In the mermaid syntax, the nodes in the main diagram part are not arranged in order, and some nodes lack the necessary hidden display format code. For example, the formats of B1, B2, B3, E1, E2, and E3 do not meet the requirements.  
3\. The description of information flow and material flow is not specific enough and lacks necessary flow nouns, making the overall logic not rigorous enough. It is necessary to clarify the specific content and connection relationship of each flow to better reflect the function implementation process.  
4\. It is necessary to ensure that the description of each flow corresponds to the functional blocks in the functional structure decomposition result to ensure the consistency of input and output logic.

It is recommended to re-examine the connection of nodes to ensure that the description of each flow is accurate and consistent with the logic of function implementation. At the same time, ensure the correctness and completeness of mermaid syntax for smooth rendering.

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Reason for rejection and modification comments$  
A logic check found the following issues:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition results, the connections between functional blocks are insufficient. For example, F4 (intelligent driving system) cannot be directly connected to F8 (high-end customized service), although personalized adjustments may affect the functionality of the intelligent driving system.  
2\. The corresponding relationship between the output flow and the functional black box diagram is not fully reflected. For example, F2 (power management system) directly outputs electric energy, but the relationship between its output and input is not clear, which may lead to unclear logic.  
3\. Material flow, information flow and energy flow include behavioral descriptions and fail to strictly follow the requirement of "flow nouns". For example, when describing connections, they fail to completely avoid using action words.  
4\. In the mermaid syntax section, the connection format of some nodes may not meet the requirements, especially the type and direction of the flow are not strictly distinguished, so please check carefully.  
5\. There are some nodes in the project that are not arranged in order. For example, the input streams of B1, B2, and B3 should have clear directions before each function block. At the same time, you should check whether the hidden display format code is complete.

It is recommended that when modifying, ensure that the connections between function blocks are clearer, the association between the output stream and the input stream is clear, and the naming rules of the stream are followed to avoid the use of action verbs. At the same time, ensure the correctness and completeness of mermaid syntax.
