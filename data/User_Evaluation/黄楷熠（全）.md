\<Start establishing an evaluation benchmark framework\>  
\[Thought\]  
In order to build a design baseline framework, we need to extract key requirements from \[Background\] and transform them into specific evaluation indicators. We group these metrics into several main categories, such as stability, security, portability, automation, and versatility. Specific indicators under each category will be set based on design needs and given preliminary weights to reflect their importance in the entire design.

We will limit the number of evaluation indicators to no more than 10 to ensure the operability and focus of the evaluation process. At the same time, we ensure that these indicators can be dynamically adjusted when subsequent customer needs and engineering characteristics are determined.

\<Evaluation benchmark framework\>

| Serial number | Evaluation index | Description | Preliminary weight |  
|------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|  
| 1 | High temperature resistance | Can it work stably in a high temperature environment of 800℃ to 1000℃ | 20% |  
| 2 | Data accuracy | Whether the accuracy of collected data is less than 0.01 | 15% |  
| 3 | Data real-time | Whether the data can be fed back in real time, if not, whether it has data storage function | 15% |  
| 4 | Equipment weight | Whether the equipment weight is less than 10kg | 10% |  
| 5 | Equipment size | Is the equipment small enough to fit within the space constraints of the gas turbine | 10% |  
| 6 | Early warning function | Whether there is an effective early warning mechanism and whether it can promptly remind abnormal situations | 15% |  
| 7 | Material selection | Whether to use high temperature resistant, lightweight materials, such as ceramic materials or high temperature alloys | 10% |  
| 8 | Sensor technology | Whether efficient and high-precision sensors are used, such as fiber optic sensors or infrared sensors | 5% |

\<Evaluation benchmark framework\>

In this framework, high temperature resistance, data accuracy, real-time data and early warning functions are the most critical indicators, so they are given a higher weight. Equipment weight and size are also important, but less important. Material selection and sensor technology are supportive indicators with relatively low weight. This framework provides direction for subsequent design decisions and can be adapted as customer needs and engineering characteristics are further clarified.

\#\#\# Explain the reasons for selecting the importance

1\. \*\*High temperature resistance (level 5)\*\*:  
   \- This is the basic requirement for equipment to work in a gas turbine. Ensuring that the equipment operates normally in a high temperature environment of 800°C to 1000°C is one of the core challenges of the project, which directly affects the reliability and life of the equipment.

2\. \*\*Data Accuracy and Real-time Feedback (Level 5)\*\*:  
   \- High accuracy and real-time are key performance indicators of monitoring equipment, which directly affect the identification and processing of abnormal conditions and are the core functions to achieve project goals.

3\. \*\*Early Warning and Safety Function (Level 4)\*\*:  
   \- The early warning mechanism is crucial to promptly remind abnormal conditions and ensure the safe operation of the system. Although it is not a core function, its importance cannot be ignored.

4\. \*\*Compact and lightweight design (Level 4)\*\*:  
   \- The compact and lightweight design facilitates installation and operation, meets portability needs, and is an important selling point in the market competition.

5\. \*\*Environmental Adaptability (Level 3)\*\*:  
   \- Maintaining functionality in complex environments, while important, is secondary to core requirements such as high-temperature performance and data accuracy.

6\. \*\*Smart Data Analysis and Remote Monitoring (Level 3)\*\*:  
   \- Improve data processing capabilities and user convenience. Although it improves user experience, it is an added-value function in the project.

7\. \*\*User Friendliness (Level 2)\*\*:  
   \- Although user-friendliness can improve user satisfaction, it has a relatively low priority in the face of technical requirements.

8\. \*\*Easy to Maintain (Level 3)\*\*:  
   \- Ease of maintenance helps reduce total cost of ownership and equipment downtime and is an important factor when considering the life cycle of a project.

9\. \*\*Data Security (Level 4)\*\*:  
   \- Data security is critical to protect data integrity and prevent information leakage, especially in industrial environments involving sensitive operations.

10\. \*\*Cost Effectiveness (Level 3)\*\*:  
    \- Cost effectiveness affects the economics and market competitiveness of the project, but it has a slightly lower priority until the functionality is implemented. ,,

\<Evaluation benchmark framework\>

\*\*Adjustment instructions:\*\*  
1\. \*\*High Temperature Resistance\*\*: The weight dropped slightly but remains high as it was rated as the highest priority among customer needs.  
2\. \*\*Data accuracy and real-time\*\*: The importance remains unchanged because it is also the highest priority among customer needs.  
3\. \*\*Early Warning Function\*\*: The weight dropped slightly, but still remained high because customers have higher requirements for safety functions.  
4\. \*\*Device Weight and Dimensions\*\*: Weights remain unchanged due to their importance to operability and user experience.  
5\. \*\*Material Selection\*\*: Slightly reduce the weight to balance other more critical indicators.  
6\. \*\*Sensor technology, intelligent data analysis and remote monitoring, data security\*\*: These are performance and charm requirements among customer needs, which have lower weight but still need to be considered.

In this way, we ensure that the evaluation indicator system is comprehensive and accurate, while also being able to dynamically adjust to the needs of specific projects. ,,

2\. \*\*Identify potential conflicts\*\*:  
   \- In the analysis, data security scored the highest, indicating that it is of greatest importance to customer needs and should be prioritized for optimization.  
   \- Materials have the same scores as high-temperature resistance, data accuracy, and data processing speed, and their priorities in practical applications need to be further analyzed.  
   \- Equipment size and equipment weight scores are the same and relatively low, and the optimization sequence can be performed later.  
   \- Since users consider data security to be of higher weight than data size and data security, data security should be prioritized in the optimization sequence.

3\. \*\*Optimization Suggestions\*\*:  
   \- Prioritize data security optimization to ensure system security and reliability.  
   \- Secondly, optimize materials and high temperature resistance to meet the needs of use in high temperature environments.  
   \- Next, improve data accuracy and data processing speed to enhance the system’s real-time feedback capabilities.  
   \- Then, consider improvements in sensor types to increase the accuracy of data collection.  
   \- Finally, optimize device size and weight to achieve a compact and lightweight design.

\<Engineering Characteristics Optimization Strategy\>  
\--Start updating evaluation criteria--  
\[Thought\]

Based on customer needs and engineering characteristics, we need to integrate and optimize the initially proposed evaluation benchmark framework. The following are specific adjustment ideas:

1\. \*\*Merging similar indicators\*\*: Merge "material selection" and "high temperature resistance" because they are essentially to improve the high temperature resistance of the equipment.  
2\. \*\*Adjust weight allocation\*\*: Redistribute weights based on the priority of customer needs and the recommended order of engineering features. For example, increase the weight of data security.  
3\. \*\*Optimize the number of indicators\*\*: Limit the number of evaluation indicators to no more than 10 to ensure that each indicator can effectively reflect key needs and characteristics.

\<Evaluation benchmark framework\>

| Serial number | Evaluation index | Description | Weight |  
|------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|  
| 1 | High temperature resistance and material selection | Can it work stably in a high temperature environment of 800℃ to 1000℃, and use high temperature resistant materials | 20% |  
| 2 | Data accuracy | Whether the accuracy of collected data is less than 0.01 | 15% |  
| 3 | Data real-time | Whether the data can be fed back in real time, if not, whether it has data storage function | 15% |  
| 4 | Equipment weight | Whether the equipment weight is less than 10kg | 10% |  
| 5 | Equipment size | Is the equipment small enough to fit within the space constraints of the gas turbine | 8% |  
| 6 | Early warning function | Whether there is an effective early warning mechanism and whether it can promptly remind abnormal situations | 12% |  
| 7 | Sensor technology | Whether efficient and high-precision sensors are used, such as fiber optic sensors or infrared sensors | 5% |  
| 8 | Intelligent data analysis and remote monitoring | Whether the device has intelligent data analysis capabilities and supports remote monitoring | 5% |  
| 9 | Data security | Does the device ensure the security of data transmission and storage | 10% |

\<Evaluation benchmark framework\>

\*\*Adjustment instructions:\*\*  
1\. \*\*High temperature resistance and material selection\*\*: Material selection and high temperature resistance are combined, and the weight is increased to 20% to reflect its importance.  
2\. \*\*Data accuracy and real-time\*\*: The importance remains unchanged because it is also the highest priority among customer needs.  
3\. \*\*Early Warning Function\*\*: The weight dropped slightly, but still remained high because customers have higher requirements for safety functions.  
4\. \*\*Device weight and size\*\*: The weight is slightly adjusted to ensure the operability and user experience of the device.  
5\. \*\*Data Security\*\*: The weight is increased to 10% to reflect the importance customers attach to data security.  
6\. \*\*Sensor Technology, Intelligent Data Analytics and Remote Monitoring\*\*: These are performance and charisma needs among customer needs, which have lower weight but still need to be considered.

In this way, we ensure that the evaluation indicator system is comprehensive and accurate, while also being able to dynamically adjust to the needs of specific projects. ,,\# Product design brief

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$  
$Reason for rejection and modification comments$  
1\. In the functional block diagram, the input streams (B1, B2, B3) and output streams (E1, E2) are not connected correctly between the function block (A) and the function block (F1-F12). The connection between function blocks only exists between the function block and the input and output streams, lacking clear fluidity.    
2\. Function blocks (F1-F12) are not connected through any streams, resulting in incomplete function implementation logic.    
3\. The function block fails to effectively demonstrate the complete process from input to output, lacking the necessary intermediate flow.    
4\. Material flow, information flow or energy flow includes some actions (such as "initiation") and should only contain the noun of the flow.    
5\. You need to ensure that the format of all nodes starting with B or E meets the requirements, including hidden format codes.    
6\. Mermaid syntax needs to be checked to ensure that it can be rendered correctly. The format of the stream should be consistent to avoid format confusion.    
It is recommended to revisit the connections between function blocks and ensure that each function block is connected through a valid stream while following mermaid syntax and format requirements. $Reason for rejection and modification comments$

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Reason for rejection and modification comments$  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition results, there are areas that do not meet the requirements in the connection part. For example, in the connection between nodes, the use of energy flow, material flow and information flow does not fully comply with the regulations. The specific content of each flow should be made clear and the correct connection format should be followed.  
2\. The nodes of the input stream and output stream (B1, B2, B3, E1, E2) are not arranged in numerical order, and there is no hidden format code at the end of the Mermaid statement.  
3\. In the connections between function blocks, some connections lack necessary flow nouns, resulting in unclear connections.  
4\. In the legend part, there is no clear distinction between the Legend diagram and the Main diagram, and there are nodes starting with L in the Main diagram, which is contrary to the requirements.

It is recommended to make the following modifications to the functional structure decomposition results:  
\- Ensure that all stream connections meet the requirements and only use the corresponding stream format.  
\- Check to make sure the input and output nodes are in the correct format and order, and add format codes to hide the display.  
\- Be clear about the specific content of the flow involved in each connection and avoid including behaviors in the connection.  
\- Make sure the contents of Legend and Main diagrams are separated to avoid confusion.

\[Thought\]  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition, all functional blocks are consistent with the requirements in the design brief, and basic functions, special functions, performance indicators, environmental adaptability and user needs are fully reflected.  
2\. Check the connections between functional blocks and find that the input signals (electric energy, temperature data, operating status data) can effectively drive the monitoring system (A), and the output signals (monitoring data, abnormal warning information) and the output of the functional black box diagram Consistent, ensuring flow integrity.  
3\. All behaviors have corresponding functional blocks. The connections between nodes are only through material flow, information flow or energy flow. There is no description of actions or behaviors.  
4\. Material flow, information flow and energy flow only contain the noun of flow and do not contain actions or behaviors.  
5\. There are no direct connections between nodes in material flow and information flow, and all connections conform to the definition of flow.  
6\. The connections between nodes are sufficient, there are multiple flows, and the types of different flows are correctly distinguished.  
7\. The input signal and output signal correspond to the input and output of the functional black box diagram. The input signal drives the system and the output signal is as expected.  
8\. All nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` are in the correct format, with the content being '\[ \]', such as "E1\[ \]".  
9\. All nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` have hidden format codes.  
10\. All nodes that do not start with \`B\` or \`E\` do not contain hidden format codes.  
11\. The syntax of mermaid is correct, the connection format of the flow meets the requirements, and there is no confusion in the representation of energy flow, material flow and information flow.  
12\. The main graph and legend are separated. There are no nodes starting with \`L\` in the main graph.

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
When checking the functional structure decomposition results in \[Target\], the following points need to be noted:

1\. \*\*Function F1\*\*: Receive power \-\> Power management module starts  
   \- Ensure that the power management module can effectively receive power and start up. This is the basis for the normal operation of the system.

2\. \*\*Function F2\*\*: Receive temperature data \-\> Sensor module collects temperature  
   \- The sensor module needs to have the ability to collect temperature data and ensure the accuracy and real-time nature of the data.

3\. \*\*Function F3\*\*: Receive operating status data \-\> Sensor module collects operating status  
   \- Similar to function F2, the sensor module also needs to have the ability to collect operating status data. Confirm whether the input and output streams of these two functions overlap or conflict.

4\. \*\*Function F4\*\*: Data processing \-\> Process the collected temperature and…  
   \- This function needs to further clarify the specific details of data processing and the processed output.

Taken together, functions F2 and F3 involve data collection from the sensor module, but their specific relationship with the data processing of function F4 is not clear. It is necessary to ensure that the input and output flows of each function are seamlessly connected in the overall system, and the description of function F4 needs to be complete to ensure that the functional decomposition of the system has a clear logical structure.

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
\[Thought\]  
1\. Review each functional block and determine whether there are other flows that are essential for functional implementation based on the design brief in \[Background\]. The definition of function blocks F1 to F6 complies with the requirements of the design brief, covering functions such as power supply, data collection, data processing, monitoring output and early warning, and no omissions were found.  
2\. Check whether all functional blocks are effectively connected, and the flow in the diagram can realize the complete process from input to output. All functional blocks can only be connected through material flow, information flow or energy flow. The connections between functional blocks are reasonable, the use of energy flow, material flow and information flow is logical, and the complete process from input to output can be realized.  
3\. Check whether each behavior corresponds to a functional block (node), and do not include behaviors in material flow, information flow or energy flow. All nodes are functional blocks, and no description of behavior appears.  
4\. Check whether material flow, information flow or energy flow contains and only contains nouns of flow, and does not contain actions or behaviors. All flows are nouns and meet the requirements.  
5\. Check that there should be no direct connections between nodes in material flow, information flow or energy flow, and no flow nouns should appear. All connections conform to the noun status of streams.  
6\. Check whether the connection between nodes is sufficient. Only one of material flow, information flow or energy flow may not appear before two nodes, and the same flow can also have multiple flows. The connections are sufficient and diverse to meet logical requirements.  
7\. Check whether these flows correspond to the input and output of the functional black box diagram in \[Background\]. The initial input of the system should be driven by the input of the functional black box diagram, and the final output should be consistent with the output of the functional black box diagram. The input and output flows are consistent with the functional black box diagram and meet the requirements.  
8\. Check the format of all nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and arranged in numerical order. The content should be '\[ \]', such as "E1\[ \]". All node formats meet the requirements.  
9\. Check the format of all nodes (nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and arranged in numerical order). There should be a hidden format code at the end of the mermaid statement, such as "style B1 fill:transparent,stroke:none ". All code that conforms to the format and has hidden display.  
10\. Check the format of all non-(nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and arranged in numerical order). There should be no hidden format code at the end of the mermaid statement, such as "style B1 fill:transparent,stroke :none". All non-node formats are eligible.  
11\. Check the mermaid syntax to ensure that it can be rendered correctly. The connection needs to meet the following format: energy flow is represented by a solid arrow, the format is \`A \-- x \--\> B\`, where x is the specific energy (required); material flow is represented by a dotted line The arrow indicates that the format is \`A \-. For specific information (required). The formats meet the requirements.  
12\. Check that the Main diagram and the Legend diagram should be separated. No nodes starting with \`L\` and arranged in numerical order should not appear in the Main diagram. The main figure and legend are separated, and no nodes starting with L appear.

$Reason for rejection and modification comments$

1\. \*\*Diversity\*\*:  
   \- Each functional module provides four plans, which seems to have sufficient diversity on the surface, but there is not much difference between the plans of some modules. For example, local storage cards and hybrid storage (local \+ cloud) in the data storage module may overlap in functionality and fail to provide significantly different options.  
   \- Improvement suggestions: Increase the uniqueness and difference of the solutions to ensure that each solution is obviously different in terms of functions and application scenarios.

2\. \*\*Feasibility\*\*:  
   \- Some solutions may face technical challenges in practical application. For example, solar powered systems may not be practical in the high temperature environment of a gas turbine.  
   \- Improvement suggestions: Conduct a feasibility analysis on each plan to ensure that it can be realized in actual projects, especially considering the impact of environmental factors on the plan.

3\. \*\*Innovation\*\*:  
   \- The plan lacks breakthrough new technologies or design ideas. For example, cloud computing platforms and edge computing units in data processing modules are common technology choices and fail to reflect innovation.  
   \- Improvement suggestions: Introduce emerging technologies or unique design ideas, such as using artificial intelligence for data processing or using new materials.

4\. \*\*Redundancy\*\*:  
   \- The solutions of some functional modules may be too similar, resulting in redundancy. For example, the online training platform and video tutorials and documentation support in the User Training and Support module may overlap in functionality.  
   \- Improvement suggestions: Remove or merge solutions with similar functions to reduce redundancy and improve the effectiveness and pertinence of the solutions.
