\#\#\# Explanation of reasons for importance selection

1\. \*\*Automatic collection mechanism (5)\*\*  
   \- This is a core function of the product, which directly affects the ease of use and user satisfaction of the product. Efficient and convenient cleaning function is an important factor for users to choose this type of product.

2\. \*\*Soft bristles (4)\*\*  
   \- When it comes to pet products, comfort is paramount. The soft bristles can effectively reduce irritation to pet skin and increase pet acceptance and comfort.

3\. \*\*Quiet Operation (5)\*\*  
   \- Quiet operation is an important requirement for pet products because many pets are sensitive to noise, and low noise can improve product usability and user satisfaction.

4\. \*\*Ergonomic handle (4)\*\*  
   \- A comfortable grip can greatly improve the user experience and reduce fatigue during long-term use, which is especially important for frequently used tools.

5\. \*\*Lightweight materials (3)\*\*  
   \- While lightweight materials help reduce wrist strain, their impact is less significant than comfortable grip and low noise, so it's slightly less important.

6\. \*\*Removable components (4)\*\*  
   \- Design that facilitates cleaning and maintenance can significantly improve user experience and product durability, so it is of high importance.

7\. \*\*Anti-misuse design (3)\*\*  
   \- Safety is a basic requirement, but is of medium importance as the product is mainly used for pet grooming and the risk of misuse is low.

8\. \*\*Appearance design (2)\*\*  
   \- Although appearance design can improve product appeal, it is less important than functional requirements and mainly affects users' first choice.

9\. \*\*Use environmentally friendly materials (2)\*\*  
   \- The use of environmentally friendly materials is in line with modern trends, but has little impact on the user's direct experience, so its importance is relatively low.

2\. \*\*Recommendations for the order in which engineering characteristics are satisfied\*\*:  
\<Engineering Characteristics Optimization Strategy\>  
1\. Material density (choose lightweight materials, target density is 1.0-1.5 g/cm³)  
2\. Handle material (different materials can be used to optimize grip comfort)  
3\. Noise level (operating noise should be less than 50 dB)  
4\. Collection mechanism capacity (target capacity is 50-100 ml)  
5\. Component removable (all designs must include removable parts)  
6\. Bristle softness (bristle hardness range is 40-60 A)  
7\. Handle size (handle diameter is 2.5-3.5 cm, length is 10-15 cm)  
8\. Environmental resistance (materials must be resistant to moisture and corrosion)  
9\. Color selection (specific color selection in pastel tones)  
10\. Standardized size (brush head size must comply with market standards)  
\<Engineering Characteristics Optimization Strategy\>  
\--Start updating evaluation criteria--  
\[Thought\]

1\. \*\*Summary and integration\*\*: Based on customer needs and project characteristics, integrate and optimize the preliminary evaluation benchmark framework to ensure that the indicators do not exceed 10 items and can effectively reflect key needs and characteristics.

2\. \*\*Optimization and Adjustment\*\*: Adjust preliminary weights based on the importance of customer needs and engineering feature scores. Automatic collection mechanisms, quiet operation, soft bristles and ergonomic handles are considered important customer needs, so the weight of these indicators needs to be appropriately increased.

3\. \*\*Customization and Application\*\*: Taking into account the particularity of the project, ensure that the evaluation index system can adapt to the requirements of the current design task. For example, the definition and weight of certain indicators can be adjusted according to the needs of a specific design project.

$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition, although the input and output flows are described, the flow direction between each functional module is not clearly specified in the connection part, resulting in the possibility that the process from input to output cannot be completely realized.  
2\. In the connection of functional modules, the specific nature and connection method of material flow, information flow or energy flow are not specified, and the necessary flow description is missing, resulting in unclear connections.  
3\. In the description, the outputs of nodes E1, E2, E3, and E4 do not have specific content descriptions, and the specific nature of these outputs should be clearly pointed out.  
4\. It is necessary to ensure that the format of all nodes meets the requirements of standardized language expression. In particular, nodes starting with B or E need to have a hidden format code at the end of the mermaid statement.  
5\. In Mermaid syntax, connections need to meet the correct format of energy flow, material flow and information flow. The current representation method may be confusing and needs to be further clearly distinguished.

It is recommended to re-examine the connections between functional modules to ensure that the description of the flow is clear and logical, and the content of the output nodes should also be further detailed. Also, check the mermaid syntax for accuracy and completeness to ensure it renders correctly. $Reason for rejection and modification comments$

$Judgment result: reject$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition diagram, there are direct connections between nodes. For example, in "A \--\> F1 \[Start autonomous flight system\]" no information related to material flow appears in the connection state.  
2\. Verbs or actions appear in material flow, information flow or energy flow. For example, "user operation information" should be changed to "user operation data" to conform to the noun format of the flow.  
3\. The checked flow does not completely correspond to the input and output of the functional black box diagram in \[Background\]. It is necessary to ensure that the initial input of the system is driven by the input of the functional black box diagram, and the final output should be consistent with the output of the functional black box diagram.

It is recommended to modify the following content:  
\- Ensure that all streams contain only nouns, not verbs or actions.  
\- Ensure that connections between nodes conform to the definition of the stream and should not be connected directly.  
\- Ensure that each flow is consistent with the inputs and outputs of the functional black box diagram, making necessary adjustments.

$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. There is a problem with the connection between functional modules. Among the connections between functional modules and input or output streams, some connections do not have an explicit flow description. For example, the connection between function module F1 and input stream B1 should clearly describe the flow of hair, rather than just using the vague description of "material flow".  
2\. In the main diagram, the connection methods between functional modules and output flows are inconsistent, and some connections do not strictly follow the prescribed format. For example, the specific type of flow (material flow, information flow, or energy flow) is not clearly marked.  
3\. In the connection between the functional module and the input stream, there is a lack of specific description of the stream, resulting in an inability to clearly understand the relationship between the modules.  
4\. The format of all nodes starting with B or E should be in the form of "\[ \]", and there should be a hidden format code at the end.  
5\. The naming of each stream needs to be checked to ensure that they comply with the input and output requirements of the functional black box diagram in \[Background\] to ensure overall logical consistency.

It is recommended to add specific flow descriptions to the functional structure diagram and ensure that the format and connections of all nodes comply with regulations. In particular, the labeling of energy flow, material flow and information flow should be clear and accurate.

\`\`\`  
\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
\[Thought\]  
1\. Review each functional block and determine whether there are other flows that are essential for functional implementation based on the design brief in \[Background\].  
   \- Function 1 (automatic hair collection) requires input streams B1 (hair) and B2 (pet skin contact), and output stream E1 (collected hair), which complies with the design brief.  
   \- Function 2 (soft bristles provide comfort) requires input stream B2 (pet skin contact) and output stream E2 (comfort), which is in line with the design brief.  
   \- Function 3 (ergonomic handle design) requires input stream B3 (user hand strength) and output stream E3 (comfortable grip), which is in line with the design brief.  
   \- Function 4 (intelligent function usage tips) requires input stream B4 (user operation information) and output stream E4 (usage tips), which conforms to the design brief.

2\. Check whether all functional blocks are effectively connected, and the flow in the diagram can realize the complete process from input to output. All functional blocks can only be connected through material flow, information flow or energy flow.  
   \- The connections between all function blocks are logical and the flow direction is clear.

3\. Check whether each behavior corresponds to a functional block (node), and do not include behaviors in material flow, information flow or energy flow.  
   \- Each function block is clearly defined, no behavior is included in the flow.

4\. Check whether material flow, information flow or energy flow contains and only contains nouns of flow, and does not contain actions or behaviors.  
   \- All streams contain only nouns, no actions or behaviors.

5\. Check that there should be no direct connections between nodes in material flow, information flow or energy flow, and no flow nouns should appear.  
   \- All connections have explicit stream nouns, there are no direct connections.

6\. Check whether the connection between nodes is sufficient. There may not be only one of material flow, information flow or energy flow between two nodes, and the same flow can also have multiple flows.  
   \- Connections between all nodes are sufficient and correct, in the presence of multiple flows.

7\. Check whether these flows correspond to the input and output of the functional black box diagram in \[Background\]. The initial input of the system should be driven by the input of the functional black box diagram, and the final output should be consistent with the output of the functional black box diagram.  
   \- Input and output streams are consistent with functional black box diagrams.

8\. Check the format of all nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and arranged in numerical order. The content should be '\[ \]', such as "E1\[ \]".  
   \- All \`B\` and \`E\` nodes are in the correct format.

9\. Check the format of all nodes (nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and arranged in numerical order). There should be a hidden format code at the end of the mermaid statement, such as "style B1 fill:transparent,stroke:none ".  
   \- All nodes have hidden display format codes.

10\. Check the format of all non-(nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and arranged in numerical order). There should be no hidden format code at the end of the mermaid statement, such as "style B1 fill:transparent,stroke: none".  
    \- All nodes that are not \`B\` or \`E\` are in the correct format.

11\. Check the mermaid syntax to ensure that it can be rendered correctly. The connection needs to meet the following format:  
    \- The format of all streams conforms to mermaid syntax, and there is no format confusion.

12\. Check that the Main diagram and the Legend diagram should be separated. No nodes starting with \`L\` and arranged in numerical order should not appear in the Main diagram.  
    \- Main diagram and Legend diagram are separated and meet the requirements.

$Reason for rejection and modification comments$

\#\#\# Reason for rejection:  
1\. \*\*Diversity\*\*:  
   \- Each functional module does provide multiple candidate solutions, but some modules have a smaller number of solutions. For example, the "Soft Bristle" module only has four options, which may limit the variety of designs.  
     
2\. \*\*Feasibility\*\*:  
   \- Some combinations may have engineering feasibility issues. For example, combining a "magnetic hair capture device" with a "high-intensity vacuum device" may result in increased design complexity and cost.  
   \- "Built-in Bluetooth and mobile phone application" may be contradictory when combined with "no electrical parts, only mechanical design" because mechanical design usually does not involve electronic components.

3\. \*\*Innovation\*\*:  
   \- Although there are some innovative design ideas, there is a lack of breakthrough innovation overall. For example, "rotating brush head and built-in vacuum cleaner" and "power fan-assisted collection" are common design ideas and lack uniqueness.

4\. \*\*Redundancy\*\*:  
   \- There are some redundant designs. For example, the functions of the two modules "automatic collection mechanism" and "efficient automatic collection mechanism" overlap, which may lead to design complexity and increased cost.

\#\#\# Modification comments:  
1\. \*\*Increase diversity\*\*:  
   \- Increase the number of candidates for each functional module, especially the "Soft Bristle" and "Lightweight Material" modules. Consider more bristle designs of different materials and structures, as well as more lightweight yet strong materials.

2\. \*\*Improve feasibility\*\*:  
   \- Re-evaluate the combination of each functional module to ensure that each combination is engineering feasible. Avoid combining incompatible design solutions.  
   \- For complex design solutions, add detailed engineering analysis and cost assessment.

3\. \*\*Enhance innovation\*\*:  
   \-Introducing more cutting-edge technologies and unique design ideas. For example, consider using smart sensors to detect the density and length of your pet's hair to automatically adjust the stiffness and length of the bristles.  
   \- Explore new materials and manufacturing processes, such as 3D printing technology to customize brush heads and handles.

4\. \*\*Reduce Redundancy\*\*:  
   \- Merge modules with similar functions to simplify the design. For example, the "automatic collection mechanism" and "efficient automatic collection mechanism" are merged into one module to uniformly consider collection efficiency and mechanism design.  
   \- Optimize modular design to ensure that each module has clear functions and values ​​to avoid duplication of design.

Through the above modifications, the diversity, feasibility and innovation of design solutions can be improved, while redundant designs can be reduced and the overall design solution can be optimized.

\#\#\# 1\. Supplementary function modules  
Suggested new functional modules:  
\- \*\*Smart Cleaning Reminder Module\*\*: This module can remind the user to clean it through the mobile app or LED indicator when the hair collector is almost full. This will further enhance the user experience and ensure that the hair collector always operates efficiently.  
  \- \*\*Implementation method\*\*: Detect the capacity of the hair collector through the built-in sensor, and combine the intelligent connection function to feedback the information to the user's mobile application or directly prompt through the LED light.

    \- E3. Adjustable grip angle handle: Improves flexibility of use, but adds complexity.  
    \- E4. Memory foam handle: comfortable but more expensive.  
  \- \*\*Impact Assessment\*\*: The design of the handle will directly affect the user experience. Any design that increases complexity (such as adjustable grip angle) may increase production difficulty and cost. It is recommended that materials and structures be selected to simplify the design while ensuring comfort.

\#\#\# Summary and suggestions  
In the evaluation of functional modules, it is recommended to add an “intelligent cleaning prompt module” to improve user experience. At the same time, for modules related to mechanical engineering, I proposed specific optimization plans to improve the comfort and functionality of the product. In the evaluation of cross-domain modules, attention was paid to the impact of handle design on user experience to ensure its simplicity and durability.

Combining the above analysis, it can be concluded that for the design of pet grooming brushes, we need to pay attention to the actual user experience while ensuring functionality, especially the design in terms of comfort and safety. It is hoped that these suggestions can provide useful thinking and direction for subsequent design discussions.

\#\#\# 1\. Automatic collection and comfortable grooming module  
\- \*\*Bionic Design Suggestion\*\*: Learn from the current mechanism of \*\*Earth Bug\*\*, use microcurrent technology to reduce the electrostatic adsorption between hair and bristles, and reduce the possibility of hair adhering to the bristles. This can improve carding efficiency and reduce cleaning frequency.

\#\#\# 2\. User interaction and security module  
\- \*\*Bionic Design Suggestion\*\*: You can refer to \*\*Elephant's Trunk\*\* to design a flexible safety locking mechanism to ensure that it can automatically lock in the event of misoperation to avoid harm to pets. The elephant's trunk provides good inspiration in terms of flexibility and safety.

\#\#\# 3\. Structure and appearance design module  
\- \*\*Bionic Design Recommendation\*\*: Consider using high-performance biocomposites from \*\*Tree\*\*, which have high strength and flexibility and can effectively prevent deformation. This design not only improves the comfort of the handle, but also ensures the durability and environmental protection of the product.

\#\#\# 4\. Material selection  
\- \*\*Bionic Design Suggestion\*\*: Drawing on the structure of \*\*sponge\*\* and using recyclable materials with modular design, it can not only enhance the lightweight characteristics of the product, but also achieve efficient environmental adaptability. The structure of the sponge can provide better cushioning and adaptability to the product.

\#\#\# 5\. Additional functions  
\- \*\*Bionic Design Suggestion\*\*: Referring to \*\*Whale Baleen\*\*, you can design self-cleaning bristles, using subtle structures to prevent the adhesion of hair and dirt, simplifying the cleaning process.

Through the above bionic design suggestions, the wisdom of nature can be applied to the design of pet grooming brushes to improve the practicality and user experience of the product.

\<Function module update\>  
Total number of current functional modules: 4  
Functional module 1: Merges the "automatic collection mechanism" and the "high-efficiency automatic collection mechanism". The reason is that these two modules are highly overlapping in function. The merger can simplify the design and improve collection efficiency.  
Function module 2: Replaced the "quiet operation" module, the reason is to integrate this function into the design of the "user interaction and security module" to improve overall security and user experience.  
Functional module 3: remains unchanged and is still the "ergonomic handle" on the grounds that this module has unique value in improving user comfort.  
Functional Module 4: Modified the "Detachable Components" module on the grounds that it is subdivided into "Easy Disassembly Design" and "Cleaning and Maintenance Design" to better adapt to the user's maintenance needs.

\#\#\# TRIZ engineering parameter analysis

\#\#\#\# 1\. Identified TRIZ project parameters

\- \*\*TRIZ parameter 1\*\*: Material density (select lightweight materials, target density is 1.0-1.5 g/cm³)  
\- \*\*TRIZ Parameter 2\*\*: Handle material (different materials can be used to optimize grip comfort)  
\- \*\*TRIZ Parameter 3\*\*: Noise level (operating noise should be less than 50 dB)  
\- \*\*TRIZ Parameter 4\*\*: Collection mechanism capacity (target capacity is 50-100 ml)  
\- \*\*TRIZ Parameter 5\*\*: Component Removable (all designs must include removable components)  
\- \*\*TRIZ parameter 6\*\*: Bristle softness (bristle hardness range is 40-60 A)  
\- \*\*TRIZ Parameter 7\*\*: Handle size (handle diameter 2.5-3.5 cm, length 10-15 cm)  
\- \*\*TRIZ Parameter 8\*\*: Environmental resistance (material must be resistant to moisture and corrosion)  
\- \*\*TRIZ parameter 9\*\*: Color selection (specific color selection in pastel tones)  
\- \*\*TRIZ Parameter 10\*\*: Standardized size (brush head size must comply with market standards)

\#\#\#\# 2\. Parameters that need to be optimized

\- \*\*TRIZ parameter 1\*\*: Material density  
  \- \*\*Reason\*\*: Choosing lightweight materials can reduce the overall weight of the product, improve comfort and reduce user fatigue.  
    
\- \*\*TRIZ parameter 3\*\*: Noise level  
  \- \*\*Reason\*\*: The operating noise should be less than 50 dB to ensure that the product will not disturb pets during use and improve user experience.

\- \*\*TRIZ parameter 4\*\*: Collection mechanism capacity  
  \- \*\*Reason\*\*: The efficient collection mechanism capacity can improve the efficiency and convenience of hair collection and reduce the frequency of user cleaning.

\- \*\*TRIZ parameter 6\*\*: Bristle softness  
  \- \*\*Reason\*\*: The softness of the bristles directly affects the comfort of the pet. Optimizing the softness of the bristles can reduce irritation to the pet's skin.

\- \*\*TRIZ parameter 5\*\*: Component removability  
  \- \*\*Reason\*\*: The detachability of components affects the cleaning and maintenance convenience of the product. Optimizing this parameter can improve the user experience and product durability.

\#\#\#\# 3\. Deterioration of parameters is acceptable

\- \*\*TRIZ parameter 7\*\*: handle size  
  \- \*\*Reason\*\*: The handle size can vary moderately within a certain range, but it should not significantly affect the comfort of use. Moderate deterioration is acceptable to accommodate different design needs or material changes.

\- \*\*TRIZ parameter 9\*\*: color selection  
  \- \*\*REASON\*\*: Changes in color selection do not significantly affect the functionality and comfort of the product and therefore can be adjusted within acceptable limits to suit market trends or material availability.

\- \*\*TRIZ parameter 10\*\*: standardized size  
  \- \*\*Reason\*\*: The standardization of brush head size allows for some flexibility, especially when compatible with different models of products, and slight deterioration can be accepted to comply with market and production needs. ,
