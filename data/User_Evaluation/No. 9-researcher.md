\<Detailed customer requirements\>

Through the above detailed list of customer requirements, you can ensure that the design project can meet customer expectations in all aspects and gain a competitive advantage in the market through innovative features.  
\--Complete identification of customer needs \--

\-- Start customer demand ranking \--  
Based on the task context and description of the client's needs, I will evaluate and rank those needs. The following is a description of the importance level of customer needs and their reasons:

1\. \*\*Friction Load Measurement\*\* \- Importance Level: 5  
   Reason: Friction load measurement is the core function of test equipment, which directly affects the accuracy and reliability of test results. It is the focus of equipment design, ensuring that the performance of mortise-and-tenon joint structures under fretting fatigue conditions can be accurately simulated and measured.

2\. \*\*Positive Pressure Measurement\*\* \- Importance Level: 5  
   Reason: Positive pressure measurement is also a key indicator for evaluating the fatigue performance of mortise-and-tenon joint structures. This, together with friction load measurement, constitutes the core parameters of fatigue testing and directly affects the accuracy of fatigue performance analysis.

3\. \*\*Simulated engine operating environment\*\* \- Importance level: 4  
   Why: Simulating real engine operating conditions, such as vibration and temperature changes, is critical to ensuring the authenticity and validity of testing. Although important, it is slightly lower relative to core measurement capabilities.

4\. \*\*High-Precision Sensors and Data Acquisition\*\* \- Importance Level: 5  
   Reason: High-precision sensors and data acquisition systems are the basis for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of test results. Especially under high temperature and vibration conditions, higher accuracy requirements are required.

5\. \*\*Real-time data collection and analysis\*\* \- Importance level: 4  
   Reason: Real-time data collection and analysis can provide instant feedback and improve test efficiency and accuracy. Although important, it is still based on high-precision measurements.

6\. \*\*User Interface Friendliness\*\* \- Importance Level: 3  
   Reason: Although user interface friendliness can improve work efficiency, its importance is slightly lower than core measurement functions and environmental simulation.

7\. \*\*Regulatory and Standards Compliance\*\* \- Importance Level: 4  
   Reason: Compliance with relevant engineering testing standards and safety regulations is a necessary condition for equipment development to ensure the safety and legal compliance of the equipment.

8\. \*\*Long-term Stability and Reliability\*\* \- Importance Level: 4  
   Reason: The stability and reliability of the equipment directly affect the consistency of the test results. Especially in long-term tests, it is very important to ensure the durability of the equipment.

9\. \*\*Modular Design\*\* \- Importance Level: 3  
   Reason: Modular design can enhance the flexibility and adaptability of the equipment, but its importance is lower than the functions that directly affect the test results.

The following is a table of customer needs after assessment:

| Customer needs | Importance level |  
|-----------------------------|------------|  
| Friction load measurement | 5 |  
| Positive Pressure Measurement | 5 |  
| Simulate engine operating environment | 4 |  
| High-precision sensors and data collection | 5 |  
| Real-time data collection and analysis | 4 |  
| User interface friendliness | 3 |

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
\[Thought\]  
1\. Check the integrity of the functional blocks: All functional blocks (F1 to F11) cover the basic functions and performance requirements mentioned in the design brief, ensuring the functional integrity of the fretting fatigue test device.  
2\. Check the input and output streams: The input streams (B1 to B4) and output streams (E1 to E4) correspond to the input and output in the functional black box diagram, and there are no omissions, which meet the design requirements.  
3\. Check the connections between functional blocks: The connections between all functional blocks (F1 to F11) are carried out through energy flow, material flow and information flow, and the flow direction is clear, and there is no inconsistency with the flow direction.  
4\. Check the correspondence between behaviors and functional blocks: Each behavior does correspond to a functional block, and no behavior is included in the material flow, information flow or energy flow.  
5\. Check the naming of flows: Material flow, information flow and energy flow all use appropriate nouns, do not contain actions or behaviors, and comply with standardization requirements.  
6\. Check the connections between nodes: The connections between all nodes are sufficient. There is no direct connection and no flow noun status, ensuring the integrity of the connection.  
7\. Check the node format: All nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and arranged in numerical order are in correct format and have hidden format codes.  
8\. Check the format of nodes that do not begin with \`B\` or \`E\`: the format of all nodes that do not begin with \`B\` or \`E\` meets the requirements, and there is no hidden format code.  
9\. Check the mermaid syntax: all connection formats are in compliance with the regulations, and the expressions of energy flow, material flow and information flow are correct and there is no confusion.  
10\. Check that the legend is separated from the main picture: there are no nodes starting with \`L\` in the main picture part, which meets the requirements.

After the above logical inspection, the functional structure decomposition results meet the requirements of the design brief.

,Here are the principles retrieved for the given numbers:

1\. \*\*Principle 27: Cheap Short-living Objects\*\*  
   \- This principle suggests using inexpensive and easily replaceable objects instead of more expensive ones that might have a longer lifespan but could cost more to replace or repair when broken.  
   \- Examples include using disposable paper cups instead of glass, plastic test tubes instead of glass, or temporary structures for certain occasions.

2\. \*\*Principle 35: Parameter Changes\*\*  
   \- This principle involves changing the characteristics or conditions of a system to achieve a better or more optimized performance.  
   \- Examples might include adjusting the concentration, flexibility, temperature, or state of a component to better suit a desired process or outcome.

3\. \*\*Principle 10: Preliminary Action\*\*  
   \- Principle 10 involves performing required changes or actions before they are needed, either fully or partially.  
   \- Some applications include using pre-pasted wallpaper, or having pre-arranged objects in a way that facilitates quick action or operation.

4\. \*\*Principle 34: Discarding and Recovering\*\*  
   \- This principle emphasizes getting rid of certain components temporarily or permanently to improve a system's operation or to recover those components later when needed.  
   \- This can be applied in different contexts such as in flexible manufacturing where unnecessary parts can be discarded to optimize production flow, or temporarily unused parts might be recovered for reuse later.

These principles offer various strategies to address and solve conflicts in systems by modifying or adapting components and processes according to the specific problem context. According to the optimization principles of TRIZ analysis, we can optimize the three combination schemes of \<Optimization combination scheme\> in SCAMPER Adjustment.
