1\. \*\*Engineering Characteristics Ranking\*\*:  
   \- Sorted according to "Total Engineering Characteristics Score", from high to low:  
     1\. Processing speed (143)  
     2\. Degree of automation (143)  
     3\. Purity standards (105)  
     4\. Recovery rate (94)  
     5\. Material strength (83)  
     6\. Simple operation interface (73)  
     7\. Regulatory requirements (45)  
     8\. Data recording and analysis functions (41)  
     9\. Dimensions (41)  
     10\. Material biocompatibility (36)  
     11\. Environmental conditions (27)  
     12\. User groups (0)  
     13\. Budget scope (0)

2\. \*\*Identify potential conflicts\*\*:  
   \- Processing speed and automation have the same score, and both are high-priority features that need to be given priority.  
   \- Purity standards and recovery rates also have higher scores, but may conflict in some cases (e.g., pursuing high purity may affect recovery rates).  
   \- Other characteristics such as material strength, ease of operation interface, regulatory requirements, etc. are relatively independent and can be optimized in parallel.

3\. \*\*Optimization direction\*\*:  
   \- Characteristics such as processing speed, degree of automation, purity standards, and recovery rates should be prioritized for optimization.  
   \- Need to ensure that while improving purity standards, recovery rates are not affected as much as possible.

\[Thought\]

According to customer needs and project characteristics, the following is the process of designing the evaluation index system:

1\. \*\*Summary and integration\*\*:  
   \- Comprehensive ranking and detailed description of customer needs, focusing on efficient cell sorting, large-throughput processing capacity, high purity, high recovery rate, degree of automation, etc.  
   \- Consider the total score of each item in the engineering characteristics scoring table, and give priority to characteristics with high scores, such as processing speed, degree of automation, purity standards, recovery rate, etc.

2\. \*\*Optimization and adjustment\*\*:  
   \- The preliminary evaluation index system includes 9 indicators, and adjustments will be made on this basis.  
   \- According to the priority of customer needs and the suggested order of project characteristics, optimize the initially set evaluation indicators and reasonably allocate the weight of each indicator.

3\. \*\*Customization and Application\*\*:  
   \- Ensure that the evaluation indicator system can flexibly respond to the particularities of the project.  
   \- Add or delete certain indicators to meet the requirements of the current design task.

The final evaluation index system is as follows:

\<Evaluation benchmark framework\>  
| Evaluation indicators | Definition | Quantitative standards | Weight (%) |  
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------|  
| High Throughput | The number of cells processed per hour to evaluate the processing capacity of the device.        | Number of cells processed per hour (unit: million) | 20 |  
| High Purity | Separate the purity standards of cell samples and evaluate the sorting quality of the device.    | Cell purity after sorting (unit: %) | 15 |  
| High recovery rate | The proportion of target cells successfully recovered during the sorting process to evaluate the efficiency of the device. | Recovery rate (unit: %) | 15 |  
| Degree of automation | The level of automation of the device affects the ease of operation and user experience.      | Automation level (low, medium, high) | 10 |  
| Ease of operation | The difficulty of user operation directly affects the user experience.              | Number of user operation steps | 10 |  
| Regulatory Compliance | The degree of compliance with industry standards or regulations, such as FDA certification and CE certification.     | Number of certifications (such as FDA, CE, etc.) | 10 |  
| Material Selection | The use of biocompatible and highly durable materials affects safety and durability. | Material biocompatibility score (1-10) | 10 |  
| Environmental adaptability | Stability under specified temperature, humidity and sterile conditions.            | Stability score (1-10) | 5 |  
| Budget Control | The ability to achieve design goals within budget constraints.                  | Budget compliance (%) | 5 |  
\<Evaluation benchmark framework\>

The above-mentioned evaluation index system combines the customer's detailed needs and engineering characteristics to ensure that each index can effectively reflect key needs and characteristics. At the same time, the weight distribution is optimized based on the importance of customer needs and the priority of engineering features, ensuring that the evaluation system is comprehensive, accurate and adapted to the requirements of the design task. ,,\# Product design brief

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure, the connections between functional blocks fail to fully follow the definitions of material flow, information flow and energy flow. For example, the connection between function 4 "record and analyze data" and function 3 "perform cell sorting" is not clear enough and lacks a clear description of the information flow.  
2\. The nodes of material flow, information flow and energy flow are directly connected. For example, "F3 \[Perform cell sorting\] \--\> F4 \[Record and analyze data\]" does not clearly indicate the information flow.  
3\. The representation of input and output streams does not fully meet the requirements of the functional black box diagram. In particular, the output streams E1 and E2 should clearly correspond to the results of function 3\.  
4\. In the Mermaid syntax, some nodes are not hidden and displayed according to the format requirements, for example, the format of "style E1 fill:transparent,stroke:none" is missing.  
5\. It is necessary to ensure that all functional blocks can be effectively connected and have complete flow directions to avoid isolated functional blocks.

It is recommended that the functional structure be re-examined to ensure that the connection, flow and representation of each functional block comply with logical and format requirements in order to achieve a complete process from input to output.

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional black box diagram, the connection between the input flow (electric energy, cell suspension, user operation instructions) and the output flow (sorted cells, data recording and analysis results) of node A does not have a clear material flow. Information flow or energy flow is distinguished, resulting in unclear logic.  
2\. There are direct connections between nodes in the functional structure black box. For example, "A \--\> E1 \[sorted cells\]" lacks flow nouns. This connection method does not meet the standards of functional flow.  
3\. In the Mermaid diagram, the format of all nodes starting with B or E (such as B1\[ \] and E1\[ \]) should ensure compliance with the standard format, but the format requirements cannot be fully followed on some nodes.  
4\. In the design of Main diagram and Legend diagram, the nodes in the Legend part should not appear in the Main diagram, causing structural confusion.

Suggested modifications are as follows:  
\- Clearly distinguish the specific flow names of input and output flows, ensuring that each node connection has a corresponding flow (material flow, information flow or energy flow).  
\- Remove the state of direct connections and ensure that all connections between nodes are through stream nouns.  
\- Check to make sure all nodes are formatted consistently, especially nodes starting with B or E.  
\- Separate the Legend diagram from the Main diagram, ensuring there is no intersection between the two.

$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition results, the connections between all functional blocks should contain flow nouns instead of direct connections. For example, "F1 \--\> F2" should be described as "F1 \-- Electricity \--\> F2" rather than a simple arrow connection.  
2\. The nodes of the input stream and output stream (nodes starting with B or E) are not identified according to the format requirements, and the format should be "E1\[ \]" etc.  
3\. In the figure, there is a direct connection without a clear description of the flow, such as "F3 \--\> F2", which should be clearly identified as "F3 \== User operation command \==\> F2".  
4\. In Mermaid syntax, ensure that the connection format of each flow is correct to avoid confusing flow types. For example, the formats of material flow, energy flow and information flow should be strictly followed.  
5\. Nodes in the Legend part and the Main part should not be mixed, and nodes starting with "L" should not appear in the Main part.

It is recommended to make the above modifications to the functional structure decomposition results to ensure clear logic and compliance with specifications. $Reason for rejection and modification comments$

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition, the connections between functional blocks are not clear enough. For example, the connection between the functional modules "User Operation" and "Data Recording and Analysis" has no clear flow direction and lacks a specific description of the information flow.  
2\. In the input and output flows, the connections between material flow, energy flow and information flow between functional blocks do not fully reflect the relationship between them, resulting in insufficient connections of some flows.  
3\. The format check of the input stream and output stream failed to pass completely, especially some node names were not formatted as required. For example, the input stream and output stream nodes fail to follow the "\[ \]" format.  
4\. In the mermaid syntax, there are possible stream format errors. In particular, the connection method of streams needs to strictly comply with the defined format to ensure that the expression of each stream is consistent.  
5\. It is necessary to ensure that the behaviors of all function blocks correspond to the corresponding function modules and avoid including behavior descriptions in the flow.

In order to solve these problems, it is recommended to re-examine the connections between function blocks, ensure that the format and connection of all input and output streams meet the requirements, avoid unnecessary behavior descriptions, and ensure the correctness of mermaid syntax.

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional breakdown diagram, all necessary flows are not clearly defined between the input and output nodes. In particular, the connections between nodes fail to fully reflect the relationship between material flow, information flow and energy flow, such as the flow relationship between the input cell suspension and electrical energy and the output sorted cells and data records. .  
2\. The description of material flow, information flow and energy flow needs to be more specific, ensuring that the name of each flow conforms to standardized language expressions and should not contain actions or behaviors.  
3\. In the mermaid syntax section, the Main diagram and the Legend diagram are not separated, resulting in possible format confusion.  
4\. You need to ensure that the format of all nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` is consistent, and that the hidden format code is included at the end of the mermaid statement.  
5\. It is necessary to check whether there is a direct connection between nodes without the status of the noun of the flow, which will lead to incomplete structural logic.

It is recommended to modify the functional structure decomposition diagram to ensure that all flows are accurately described, node connections are clear, and the format requirements are met.

$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition, after the power supply function (F1) and the cell sample receiving function (F2), there should be clear energy and material flows pointing to the cell sorting function (F3), but in the input flow part, the energy flow ( The connection between electrical energy) and material flow (cell suspension) is not clearly represented.  
2\. Connections between functional blocks do not fully represent all necessary flows. For example, the data recording and analysis function (F4) is not connected to the cell sorting function (F3), resulting in the output stream (data recording and analysis results) not clearly coming from which functional block.  
3\. In the Mermaid diagram, the legend part and the main diagram part are not effectively separated. There are direct connections (such as F1 and F3) without flow nouns, resulting in loose logic.  
4\. The input and output nodes (such as B1, B2, B3, E1, E2) do not fully follow the hidden display format code in the Mermaid diagram, and are not arranged in order.  
5\. The connections between all nodes fail to fully reflect the diversity of flows, as one flow can have multiple flows that are not reflected.

It is recommended to re-examine the connection relationship between each functional block to ensure the clear division of energy flow, material flow and information flow, and to make reasonable connections and displays based on the input and output of the functional black box diagram.

\[Thought\]  
According to the design brief in \[Background\], the core function of the micro-cell sorting device is to efficiently sort and process cell samples. In order to accomplish this core task, we need to break it down into specific functions and ensure that the streams are properly connected.

$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. In the functional structure decomposition result, there is a problem in the connection part between the function block and the flow. Specifically, the connection "F1 \-- Electrical Energy \--\> F3 \[Cell Sorting Function\]" lacks a clear description of the energy flow and should clearly indicate "Electrical Energy".  
2\. The input stream B3 (user operation instruction) of the data recording and analysis function (F4) does not clearly indicate its influence and connection. The relationship between its output stream and other functional blocks should be clarified between functional blocks.  
3\. In the definition of input streams and output streams, there is a lack of clear description of all inputs and outputs. For example, the output streams of E1 and E2 are not clearly connected to the core function block (A) in the figure.  
4\. The connections between functional blocks are insufficient, and some functional blocks lack necessary flow connections. For example, there should be clear material flow connections between F2 (cell sample receiving function) and F3 (cell sorting function).  
5\. In the mermaid syntax, the requirements for hidden formats are not followed. For example, the formats of B1, B2, B3, E1, and E2 should comply with the requirements of "\[ \]", and the hidden format code needs to be added at the end.

It is recommended to modify the above questions to ensure the logic and accuracy of the functional structure decomposition results. $Reason for rejection and modification comments$

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
$Judgment result: \<reject\>$

$Rejection reasons and modification comments$:  
1\. There is a problem with the connection between function block F4 (data logging and analysis function) and function block F5 (user interface function). The connection of the information flow from F5 to F4 should be the result of user operation, but it is not clearly identified as "user operation result" in the functional structure, but is connected directly, lacking a description of the specific information flow.  
2\. The connection between function blocks F3 (cell sorting function) and F4 (data recording and analysis function) is not clearly identified as "data recording and analysis results", but is directly connected, lacking a description of the specific output stream.  
3\. In the input and output stream section, the output stream descriptions of E1 and E2 lack clear connection stream status and do not use appropriate descriptive nouns.  
4\. In the mermaid syntax, the hidden display format of the input and output nodes is inconsistent, and the transparent style cannot be used as required.  
5\. A connection format that does not comply with the specification appears in the connection status. It is necessary to ensure that the descriptions of all flows comply with the regulations.

It is recommended to clarify the flow direction between each functional block and the name of the specific flow in the function flow diagram to ensure that all input and output flows are clear and comply with the requirements of mermaid syntax.

\--Functional structure decomposition in progress--  
\[Thought\]  
According to the design brief in \[Background\], the core function of the micro-cell sorting device is to efficiently sort and process cell samples. By decomposing functions, we can identify multiple specific functional modules and connect input and output streams reasonably.

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
When analyzing the functional structure decomposition results, the logical relationship between each functional module can be confirmed. First, the power management function (F1) is the foundation, ensuring the stable operation of the device, which is crucial for other functions. Secondly, the cell sorting function (F2), as a core function, is directly related to efficient processing of cell samples, and its sorting mechanism and standards should be specified. In addition, the rationality of connecting input and output flows also needs to be considered to ensure that the flow of information and energy is unimpeded. Overall, the functional decomposition shows logical rationality, but the details can be further explored to ensure the comprehensiveness and coordination of each functional module.
