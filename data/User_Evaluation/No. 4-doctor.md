8\. \*\*Modular Design\*\* \- Importance Level: 3  
   \- The modular design improves the flexibility and scalability of the system and facilitates maintenance and upgrades. Although it is helpful for the service life of the equipment, it is not a core requirement.

9\. \*\*Intelligence and Automation\*\* \- Importance Level: 3  
   \- The introduction of intelligent control and automated operations can improve equipment operation convenience and data analysis capabilities, but its priority is slightly lower than basic functions and accuracy requirements.

10\. \*\*Environmental friendliness and energy efficiency\*\* \- Importance level: 2  
    \- Design considering environmental factors and energy efficiency is in line with the needs of modern sustainable development, but is a lower priority than the core functions and performance of the equipment.

Through the above evaluation, we can better understand and meet customer needs and ensure that the designed equipment meets the expected goals in terms of performance, reliability and user experience. ,,

\--Start updating evaluation criteria--  
\[Thought\]  
Based on customer needs and engineering characteristics, we need to optimize and adjust the initially proposed evaluation benchmark framework to ensure that it can fully reflect the customer's core needs and important engineering characteristics. The specific steps are as follows:

1\. \*\*Summary and integration\*\*: Integrate customer needs and engineering characteristics to ensure that each evaluation indicator can reflect key requirements and characteristics.  
2\. \*\*Optimization and adjustment\*\*: According to the priority of customer needs and the suggested order of project characteristics, optimize the initially set evaluation indicators and reasonably allocate the weight of each indicator.  
3\. \*\*Customization and Application\*\*: Ensure that the evaluation index system can flexibly respond to the particularities of the project, and add or delete certain indicators to meet the requirements of the current design task.

Based on the importance of customer needs and the scoring of engineering characteristics, the final evaluation index system is as follows:

\<Evaluation benchmark framework\>

Dynamic adjustment instructions:  
\- Depending on the particularities of the specific design task, some indicators can be adjusted. For example, if a project has stricter size restrictions, the weight of "size compliance" can be increased, or if a project places special emphasis on user convenience, the weight of "user friendliness" can be increased.

\--Checking the functional structure decomposition logic--  
According to the functional structure decomposition results in \[Target\], the following is an inspection and analysis of the functional structure logic:

\#\#\# Analysis of functional structure decomposition results

1\. \*\*Control power supply\*\*  
   \- \*\*Description\*\*: Make sure the device is properly powered to support all functions.  
   \- \*\*Logic Check\*\*:  
     \- This function description is logical and needs to ensure that the device can provide stable power supply as the basis for all other functions.  
     \- As a basic function, it should be located at the beginning of the functional structure diagram and should be connected to all other functional blocks to ensure the delivery of power supply.

2\. \*\*Receive control signal\*\*  
   \- \*\*Description\*\*: Receives control signals from the user or system to regulate equipment operation.  
   \- \*\*Logic Check\*\*:  
     \- This feature relies on the power supply to function properly as it requires power to receive and process signals.  
     \- The function should occupy a key position in the input and output flow of control signals and should be directly connected in the functional block diagram to the function blocks that require these signals (e.g. regulating the rotational speed).

3\. \*\*Adjust speed\*\*  
   \- \*\*Description\*\*: Adjust the rotation speed of the sliding bearing according to the control signal.  
   \- \*\*Logic Check\*\*:  
     \- This function relies on the correct operation of the function of receiving control signals, because adjusting the speed requires receiving a control signal to make adjustments.  
     \- The function should be connected to the control signal receiving function in the functional block diagram and its output should be associated with the subsequent measurement function.

4\. \*\*Measure...\*\*  
   \- \*\*Description\*\*: The description part of this function is not fully displayed, but it can be speculated that it is related to the performance measurement of sliding bearings.  
   \- \*\*Logic Check\*\*:  
     \- If the measuring function involves the measurement of rotational speed, it needs to receive the output of the regulating rotational speed function.  
     \- The measurement function usually needs to be connected to the adjust speed function in the functional block diagram and should output the measurement results, which may need to be fed back to receive a control signal or used to adjust the speed.

\#\#\# Overall logic check

\- \*\*Functional Dependencies\*\*:  
  \- All functional dependencies should be reasonably reflected in the functional structure diagram. For example, power supply must precede all other functions, receiving control signals before adjusting the rotation speed, and adjusting rotation speed before the measurement function.  
    
\- \*\*Input and output streams\*\*:  
  \- The input and output streams of each function block should be clearly defined and connected in the correct order. Power supply is a prerequisite for all functions. The control signal input should directly affect the adjustment of the rotation speed, and the adjustment result of the rotation speed should be reflected in the measurement function.

\#\#\# Summarize

The logic of functional structure decomposition is basically correct, but it is necessary to ensure that all functional blocks and flows are properly represented in the functional structure diagram. In particular, make clear the complete description of the measurement function and how it is connected to the previous function blocks.
