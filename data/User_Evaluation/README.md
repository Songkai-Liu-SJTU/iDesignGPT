#  Scoring Template for Conceptual Design Evaluation

This repository provides a standardized scoring template and six corresponding design tasks used for evaluating the performance of four anonymized AI-assisted design solutions.

##  Contents

- `Questionnaire.xlsx`:  
  This Excel file serves as the **main scoring template**, consisting of six sheets. Each sheet corresponds to one design task, where the evaluator is invited to assess four anonymized solutions (labeled A–D) across six key dimensions.

- `*.docx` files (e.g., `Lunar Cryogenic Tech.docx`, `Soft Materials Tool.docx`, etc.):  
  Each document contains the full description of a specific conceptual design task, along with the **problem brief** and four design outputs, generated respectively by:
  - GPT-4o (zero-shot)
  - GPT-4o (chain-of-thought)
  - Deepseek-r1
  - iDesignGPT

  These outputs are randomly distributed across each task and **anonymized** as Solution A–D.

##  Questionnaire Description

The `Questionnaire.xlsx` file includes:

- **Evaluator Information** to be filled:
  - `Name:`  
  - `Design Experience (years):`  
    _Please indicate your years of experience in design and engineering._
  - `Current Industry:`  
    _Aerospace / Automotive / Energy / Other (please specify)_
  - `Highest Academic Qualification:`  
    _PhD / Master’s / Bachelor’s (please specify)_

- **Evaluation Dimensions** for each solution (A–D):
  - **Novelty**
  - **Originality**
  - **Rationality**
  - **Technical Maturity**
  - **Modularity**
  - **Efficiency**
  - **Your feedback during the evaluation**  
    _e.g., any confusion, dilemmas, or comments on the feasibility of the proposed solutions._

###  Evaluation Instructions

> Thank you for participating in this evaluation. This questionnaire consists of six questions, each distributed across six sheets in the Excel file. Please provide your personal information below to help us understand your professional background. This evaluation aims to gather insights from experts with significant experience in mechanical engineering, aerospace, automotive, and other related fields.

####  Notes:
- This evaluation is **primarily focused on the conceptual design phase**. Please avoid scoring based on detailed or finalized engineering design standards.
- All design tasks are derived from **public sources**, including NASA, Boeing, and U.S. Department of Energy design challenges.
- While each dimension includes **certain objective indicators**, they do **not** capture the full picture. Please refer to the **provided definitions** and **use your expertise** to complete the scoring.
