## Innovation Levels (TRIZ-based)

| **Level** | **Description**                                                                                   | **Example**                        |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|  Level 1 | Routine design problems solved by well-known methods within the specialty.                        | Coal for writing                   |
|  Level 2 | Minor improvements to an existing system using methods known within the industry.                 | Graphite pencil                    |
|  Level 3 | Fundamental improvement using methods from outside the industry.                                  | Ink pen                            |
|  Level 4 | New generation system with new principle; often science-based.                                    | Printer                            |
|  Level 5 | Rare scientific discovery or pioneering invention; essentially a new system.                      | Electronic pen & paper (e.g. Anoto)|
