Objective measures across five key dimensions of design evaluation were used to compare the performance of different workflows (GPT-4o-zero shot, GPT-4o-COT, Deepseek-r1, and iDesignGPT) across five dimensions: Novelty, Originality, Rationality, Technical Maturity, and Modularity. Each metric is derived from validated engineering frameworks (e.g., TRIZ, QFD, ISO 16290, Axiomatic Design).
