##  TRLs – Technology Readiness Levels 

This 9-level framework is used to evaluate the **technical maturity** of engineering systems or components.

| **Level** | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TRL 1     | Basic principles observed and reported                                           |
| TRL 2     | Technology concept and/or application formulated                                 |
| TRL 3     | Analytical and experimental proof-of-concept for critical functions/characteristics |
| TRL 4     | Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment                 |
| TRL 5     | Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment                   |
| TRL 6     | System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment      |
| TRL 7     | System prototype demonstration in a space environment                            |
| TRL 8     | Actual system completed and “flight qualified” via test and demonstration        |
| TRL 9     | Actual system “flight proven” through successful mission operations              |

> This standard provides a consistent methodology for assessing system maturity, critical for aerospace and high-risk engineering domains.
