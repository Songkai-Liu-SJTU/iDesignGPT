### Let's start with a few key questions:

1. **Design Domain**:  
   What specific field of design are you focusing on? For example, are you looking into aerospace engineering, product design, or another area?

2. **Core Functionality**:  
   What are the primary functions this rescue aircraft should perform? For instance:  
   - Should it be able to land in rough terrains?  
   - Should it carry a certain number of passengers?  
   - Does it need specific speed capabilities?

3. **Autonomy Features**:  
   What level of autonomy are you aiming for?  
   - Are you thinking of a fully autonomous aircraft?  
   - Or should it have both manual and autonomous modes?

4. **Safety and Simplicity**:  
   - What safety features are essential for your design?  
   - How do you define "simple to fly"?  
     Are you thinking of:  
     - An intuitive control system?  
     - Minimal training requirements?  
     - Something else?

5. **Special Requirements**:  
   Do you have any specific requirements or constraints? These could be related to:  
   - Budget  
   - Materials  
   - Environmental impact  
   - Regulatory compliance  
   - Or any other aspects.
