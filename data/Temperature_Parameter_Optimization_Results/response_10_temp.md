That sounds like an incredibly impactful and ambitious project! Let's break it down so we can tackle the key elements of the design and build process.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Design Domain**:
   Could you elaborate on the specific aspects of the compact, autonomy-enabled rescue aircraft you're envisioning? Are we focusing primarily on:
   - Aircraft design
   - Avionics
   - Software for autonomy
   - Human interface aspects

2. **Functional Goals**:
   What functions must the aircraft perform? For instance:
   - Autonomous flight and navigation
   - Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance
   - Rescue operations capability (e.g., carrying and delivering supplies, retrieving individuals)

3. **Safety and Simplicity**:
   When you mention it needs to be safe and simple to fly, could you provide more context on:
   - Safety features you envisage (e.g., redundancy systems, fail-safes)
   - User experience considerations for simplicity (e.g., intuitive controls, automation levels, training requirements)

4. **Special Requirements**:
   Are there any specific or unique requirements that we must keep in mind?
   - Regulatory certifications (e.g., FAA or other national aviation authorities)
   - Size and weight constraints
   - Environmental operating conditions (e.g., extreme temperatures, rough terrain adaptation)
   - Budget and timeline constraints

### Additional Considerations

- **Target Users**:
  Who will be operating or interacting with this aircraft? Is it designed for trained pilots, general emergency responders, or even laypeople with minimal training?

- **Current Challenges**:
  Are there existing technical or operational challenges youâ€™re aware of that need to be addressed?

By clarifying these points, we can start to compile a comprehensive plan and ensure that every detail aligns with your vision. Once you feel we've covered everything, we can proceed to switch to the [Customer Requirements List] mode to formalize your requirements and move forward.

Please provide your thoughts on these areas so we can tailor the solution to your specific needs!
