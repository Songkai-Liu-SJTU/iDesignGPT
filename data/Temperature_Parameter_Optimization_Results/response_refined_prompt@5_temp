This sounds like an incredibly engaging and challenging project! Let’s work together step by step to clarify your requirements and vision. Through a series of guiding questions, we can better define and plan your design proposal.
1. Design Field:
Please provide details about the design field you are focusing on. From your description, it seems we are exploring new aircraft design. Specifically:
•	Are you focusing on aerospace design, industrial design, or a combination of both?
•	Within this field, do you have specific subfields or areas of interest, such as flight control systems, airframe structural design, or material selection?
2. Desired Functionalities:
Let’s now consider the primary functionalities and goals. Our objective is to design a technically challenging, autonomy-enabled rescue aircraft. Specifically:
•	What are the core functionalities you want this rescue aircraft to achieve?
1.	Autonomous flight capabilities (e.g., GPS navigation, obstacle avoidance).
2.	Safe and simple-to-use user interface.
3.	Storage and transport capacity for rescue equipment.
4.	Fast response time and endurance for prolonged flight.
•	Are there any specific key requirements, such as:
1.	Size and weight constraints?
2.	Emergency landing features?
3.	High endurance capabilities?
3. Special Requirements:
Next, let’s consider any specific requirements or constraints:
•	Do you have a defined budget range?
•	Are there particular material preferences, such as eco-friendly or recyclable materials?
•	Are there any regulatory or environmental conditions that must be considered?
•	What rescue scenarios and harsh environmental factors are you targeting, and how will they impact the design?
4. Inspiration and References:
Do you have any inspirations or references that can help us understand your vision?
•	Are there existing rescue aircraft or similar equipment you have in mind?
•	Are there specific design styles, successful case studies, or functional implementations you would like us to incorporate?
5. Existing Challenges:
Let’s consider potential challenges during the design process:
•	Are there technical difficulties such as the complexity of building autonomous flight systems?
•	Are there manufacturing constraints or limitations?
•	How might market trends and user demands affect the design?
How can we overcome these challenges?
Additional Considerations:
•	Target Users:
Who is the primary user group for this rescue aircraft? Will it serve government rescue teams, civil organizations, or industries with specific needs?
o	Understanding users’ needs, such as their technical capabilities or ease-of-maintenance expectations, can help refine the design’s functionalities.
•	Market Demand:
Are there existing rescue aircraft solutions in the market? What are their functional features, and how will your design stand out?
o	What are the unique selling points or value propositions of your design?
