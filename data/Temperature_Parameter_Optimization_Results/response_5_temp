That sounds like an ambitious and exciting project! To help you better, I need to gather some more details about your specific needs and requirements. This will ensure that the design solution we develop is precisely tailored to your vision.
Let's start with a few key questions:
1. Design Domain: What specific field of design are you focusing on? For example, are you looking into aerospace engineering, product design, or another area?
2. Core Functionality: What are the primary functions this rescue aircraft should perform? For instance, should it be able to land in rough terrains, carry a certain number of passengers, or have specific speed capabilities?
3. Autonomy Features: What level of autonomy are you aiming for? Are you thinking of a fully autonomous aircraft, or should it have both manual and autonomous modes?
4. Safety and Simplicity: What safety features are essential for your design? How do you define 'simple to fly'? Are you thinking of an intuitive control system, minimal training requirements, or something else?
5. Special Requirements: Do you have any specific requirements or constraints? These could be related to budget, materials, environmental impact, regulatory compliance, or any other aspects.
Feel free to provide as much detail as possible. This will help me guide you more effectively in developing a breakthrough solution for your rescue aircraft.
