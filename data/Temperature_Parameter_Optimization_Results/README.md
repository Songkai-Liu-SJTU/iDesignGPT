# Temperature Parameter Optimization Results

## Introduction to Temperature Parameter Testing

The temperature parameter in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o controls the randomness of generated outputs, influencing response creativity and diversity. Conventionally, the temperature ranges from 0 to 1 in standard implementations such as OpenAI’s API. However, in this study, we employed the FastGPT platform, where the temperature parameter is rescaled to a range of 0 to 10. A higher temperature results in more varied and creative outputs, while a lower temperature generates deterministic and focused responses.

This supplementary note details the testing process for temperature settings to optimize the performance of iDesignGPT when interacting with users. Based on the analysis, we identified the optimal temperature setting and refined prompt engineering strategies to ensure high-quality, contextually relevant outputs.

## Testing Setup and Procedure

1. **Objective**: To determine the effect of different temperature values (0–10) on response quality, clarity, and user guidance.

2. **Prompt Design**: A standardized prompt was used to simulate a design consulting scenario, where the system guides users in defining their design fields, functionalities, special requirements, and other contextual details. [View the full prompt design](./prompt.md).

3. **Test Cases**: The following user input was provided to maintain consistency across temperature settings:
   ```bash
   I want you to catalyze a breakthrough solution to design and build the world’s first compact, autonomy-enabled rescue aircraft that is safe and simple to fly.
   ```
   [View the user input file](./user_input.md).

4. **Temperature Range**: Responses were generated at temperature settings of **0**, **5**, and **10**, representing low, medium, and high randomness. The outputs at each temperature are available for review:
- [Response at Temperature 0](./response_0_temp)
- [Response at Temperature 5](./response_5_temp)
- [Response at Temperature 10](./response_10_temp)

5. **Platform**: All tests were conducted using GPT-4o through the FastGPT platform.

## Results

The responses at different temperature levels (0, 5, 10) were evaluated for their structure, level of detail, and coherence. To illustrate the progression of response quality, you can review the detailed outputs in the following files:
- [Temperature 0 Output](./response_0_temp)
- [Temperature 5 Output](./response_5_temp)
- [Temperature 10 Output](./response_10_temp)

Key observations from the tests are summarized below:

| **Temperature** | **Response Characteristics**                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0                | Highly structured and focused. The response was concise, providing clear and stepwise guidance but lacking creative elaboration.                                                              |
| 5                | Balanced output. The response was structured yet detailed, offering prompts that effectively guided user thought while incorporating exploratory elements.                                      |
| 10               | Overly verbose and divergent. Responses included redundant or speculative content, occasionally introducing inconsistencies and instability in output.                                         |

## Comparative Analysis

The testing revealed that a temperature setting of **5** provided the most effective balance between response quality, creativity, and coherence. Responses at this setting were:

- **Structured and well-organized**: Prompts were presented step by step, providing logical progression.
- **Exploratory yet focused**: The system encouraged users to elaborate on their ideas without introducing irrelevant or speculative content.
- **Engaging and user-friendly**: Responses successfully guided the user while mitigating the potential intimidation associated with first-time tool use.

At the temperature extremes:

- **Temperature 0**: Produced rigid and deterministic outputs, suitable for highly constrained tasks requiring precision but lacking creativity.
- **Temperature 10**: Resulted in incoherent and unstable outputs, making it less suitable for structured design consulting workflows.

## Prompt Refinement and Optimization

Following the temperature evaluation, the prompt was further refined to adopt a more detailed, structured approach using the **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** framework. The refined prompt systematically guides the user through key design considerations. [View the refined prompt here](./refined_prompt).

The refined prompt was tested with the optimized temperature setting of 5, resulting in stable and high-quality responses. [View the full response here](./response_refined_prompt@5_temp).
