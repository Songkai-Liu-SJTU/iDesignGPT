Design title: 2025 Micro-g NExT Challenge Challenge-Lunar Operation-Contact Sampling Device

background

NASAworking onArtemisThe mission prepares to head to the Moon's South Pole. existArtemis IIIDuring the mission, astronauts will conduct extravehicular activities (EVA) to collect various lunar geological samples to study multiple scientific fields. One of the scientific research focuses is to investigate the particles that make up the lunar surface regolith (that is, the lunar surface soil), especially to study their particle size, material type, physical distribution and particle orientation, in order to understand the space weathering and history of the moon. To bring back these unique samples, astronauts will need a special contact sampling device to collect and return these samples to Earth. The area sampled must be relatively free ofEVAActivity effects (e.g., dust kicked up by the lander, material kicked up by astronauts walking) to ensure that pristine samples are collected. The device must also be able to contain and store samples for safe return to Earth. If you choose to draw from past missions (e.g. Apollo,OSIRIS-Rex), please apply lessons learned from these tasks and show how your design innovates or improves upon previous designs.

Target

Design a device that would allow astronauts in spacesuits to collect data from the lunar surface“Contact sample”, that is, collecting on the lunar surface1-5mm thick regolith and capture the orientation of surface particles. The device must have a closure method compatible with spacesuit gloves to preserve the sample and safely return it to Earth. The design should also include how scientists will extract samples from the device on Earth. Astronauts will use the device while wearing spacesuits with limited movement, so the ergonomics of the device's operation must be carefully considered in the design. The tool will be located in Houston, TexasNASAJohnson Space Center's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) to evaluate the overall functionality and operational concepts, and at the Lunar Simulation Development Laboratory (SDL) to test its ability to sample and store lunar regolith surface samples.

Normal operation should be assumed when performing stress analysis. The goal of the analysis is to identify the most critical components of the equipment (i.e., the part that fails earliest and has the lowest safety factor). Reports factors of safety based on design, selected materials, and operational input loads. Remember to consider the subcomponents of the mechanism. Note: If your proposal is selected, you will be required to provide additional stress analysis during the spring semester. | We hope that the device will also pass in the moon's gravity (the earth's gravity1/6) down from the ground4ft.

Other considerations

* Consider what the astronauts will hold onto to stabilize the equipment during operation. The handle should be suitable for use with pressurized spacesuit gloves. NOTE: Smooth, rounded rod handles in spacesuit gloves can cause hand fatigue.

Consider operating while wearing a pressurized spacesuit. Anything that requires fine hand control or puts the astronaut in an unnatural position will be more difficult in a spacesuit.
