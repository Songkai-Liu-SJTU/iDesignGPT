## **Execution logic**
The SCAMPER method operates as a creative trigger for functional enhancement. Upon initiation, the system applies SCAMPER operations (*Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse*) to stimulate reinterpretation of functional modules. For each module, design suggestions are generated through SCAMPER heuristics and returned to the user. Users can either accept the updated suggestions or request alternative outputs through iterative input. Once satisfied, the selected SCAMPER-augmented features are passed to the subsequent synthesis method.
