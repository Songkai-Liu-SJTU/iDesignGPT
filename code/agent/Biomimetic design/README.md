## **Execution logic** 
The biomimetic design process was initiated upon trigger, with a structured sequence consisting of four steps: 
1. generation of search terms derived from the design brief and morphological matrix; 
2. querying the AskNature database using these terms to retrieve relevant biological cases; 
3. analysis of the retrieved biomimetic cases to extract applicable design insights; 
4. presentation of candidate analogies for user selection. The user could either accept the proposed inspirations or revise the search parameters for re-execution. Once satisfied, the extracted analogies informed downstream conceptual design processes.
