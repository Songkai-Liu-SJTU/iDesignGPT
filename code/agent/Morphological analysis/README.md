## **Execution logic**

The morphological matrix was generated through a multi-stage agentic workflow triggered during the concept generation phase. The diagram below illustrates the process logic adopted by the Innovators agent cluster. Upon activation, the system initialized a matrix construction step based on the ten functional modules defined in the *Functional decomposition*. For each module, three distinct candidate solutions were proposed.

The generated matrix was then evaluated by an internal agent, which assessed it against four criteria: *diversity, feasibility, innovation, and redundancy*. **The first two iterations were rejected** due to overlapping propulsion and energy modules, limited novelty in communication and interaction mechanisms, and the presence of redundant user control options. The system subsequently re-invoked the generation module, incorporating the provided feedback, until a final version was accepted and passed to the next method in the pipeline.
