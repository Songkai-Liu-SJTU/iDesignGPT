Morphological Matrix-Generation  
Please use morphological matrix analysis to generate multiple possible combinations of design solutions and update the functional modules. Each functional module needs to have at least two or more implementations to ensure diversity and feasibility of design options.

\[Background\]  
Design Task Description:  
{{requirement}}

Function Modules:  
{{module\_combined}}

Previous Failure Reasons and Improvement Suggestions for the Morphological Matrix (if any):  
{{morphology\_reason}}

\[Knowledge\]

1. A morphological matrix is a systematic method for generating and evaluating design solutions. By breaking down a design task into multiple functional modules or attributes and generating several possible solutions for each, diverse design combinations can be systematically created.  
2. Requirements outlined in a design task description often include multiple functional modules or attributes, each of which may have different implementation methods.  
3. For each functional attribute, consider the current technological level, innovativeness, and engineering feasibility to generate multiple possible solutions.

\[Thought Process\]

1. First, parse the design task description and user feedback (if provided in the question) to extract the key design functional modules or attributes. If no such content appears, proceed directly with the next steps based on instructions like “morphological matrix.”  
2. For each functional module or attribute, generate multiple possible implementation solutions, ensuring at least two or more candidate solutions for each.  
3. Conduct an initial screening to eliminate obviously unreasonable or suboptimal solutions, selecting options with engineering feasibility and innovative potential.  
4. Combine the filtered solutions to form an optimized morphological matrix, listing all possible design combinations.  
5. Review the generated matrix to ensure the diversity, feasibility, and innovativeness of the solution combinations.  
6. Output a morphological matrix containing multiple implementation solutions for all functional modules and update the list for each module.

\[Output\]

1. An optimized morphological matrix that includes multiple design solution combinations for each functional module.  
2. An updated list of possible solutions for each functional module.

Note: Do not ask the user rhetorically, please proceed directly to the analysis based on your understanding of the user's questions and the reasons for the failure of the last Morphology Matrix generation and suggestions for improvement (if any).

Morphological Matrix-Evaluation  
“Please evaluate the following portfolio of design options generated by the morphological matrix, focusing on checking the following aspects:  
1\. diversity: is there a sufficient number of candidate solutions for each functional module?  
2\. feasibility: are the generated design combinations engineering feasible?  
3\. Innovativeness: Have new or unique design ideas been introduced?  
4\. redundancy: are there duplicate or unnecessary solutions?

If problems are identified, please indicate specific suggestions for improvement.”

\[Output\]  
\- First output the result of the judgment, the format of the output is: $Result of judgment: \<pass\>/\<reject\> (either one)$  
   \- If the judgment after \[Thought\] satisfies the test, you should return \<pass\>.  
   \- If the \[Thought\] judgment does not meet the assessment, you should first return \<reject\>.  
\- After that, you should continue to output the reason for rejection and modification, which should be formatted with the identifiers $rejection and modification$ at the beginning and end of the paragraph.  
   \- If the result is \<pass\>, you should return “Passed, no reasons for rejection and no modifications”.  
   \- If the result is \<reject\>, you should return the reason for rejection and modification.

Text Content Extraction  
You need to extract the results of the morphological matrix assessment in full, including both $judgment result$ and $rejection reason and modification$:  
\- For judgment results, there are identifiers like $judgment result:$, or if you can't find the identifiers, the final output field is pass or reject as you understand it.  
\- For reasons for rejection and modifications, there are identifiers $rejection reasons and modifications$ at the beginning and end of the paragraph, if you can't find the identifiers, the final output field is reasons for rejection and modifications, according to your understanding.

User-selection  
\- If you are not satisfied, you can re-generate the concept generation based on \[Morphology Matrix\], please enter \[Morphology Matrix\] first in the dialog box, followed by your comments.  
\- If you are satisfied, you can use \[Brainstorm, Initialize\] to generate innovative design solutions through multidisciplinary collaboration.
