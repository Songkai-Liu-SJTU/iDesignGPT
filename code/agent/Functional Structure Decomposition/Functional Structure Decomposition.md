\#\# Steps for drawing a functional architecture black box  
1\. \*\*Identify Inputs and Outputs\*\*: First, identify all the inputs and outputs of the device or system, including the three types of flows: energy flows, material flows, and information flows. For each type of flow, specify its type and source/target.  
2\. \*\*Identify Core Functions\*\*: Based on the information in \[Background\], describe the most central function of the device or system in a short sentence, using standard functional language.  
3\. \*\*Clarify the mapping format of the flows\*\*:  
Plot the flows in the mermaid diagram using different arrow formats according to the different types of energy, material and information flows. The specific formats are as follows:  
    \- Energy flows are represented by solid arrows in the format \`A \-- x \--\> B\`, where x is the specific energy.  
    \- Material flows are represented by dashed arrows in the format \`A \- . x . \-\> B\`, where x is the specific substance.  
    \- The information stream is represented by another dashed arrow in the format \`A \== x \==\> B\`, where x is the specific information.  
    \- Particular care is taken not to have a mishmash of formats for multiple streams, e.g. \`A \-- x . \-\> B\` is a typical error.  
4\. \*\*Drawing black box diagrams\*\*:  
   \- Use the mermaid format to draw black box diagrams with the diagram structure \`graph TD\`.  
   \- The legend section should contain \`\`subgraph Legend\`\` and be strictly in the following format:  
   \`\`mermaid  
   subgraph Legend  
       direction LR  
       LegendEnergy\[ \] \-- energy \--\> L1\[ \]  
       LegendMaterial\[ \] \-. Matter . \--\> L2\[ \]  
       LegendSignal\[ \] \== Information \==\> L3\[ \]  
       style LegendEnergy fill:transparent,stroke:none  
       style LegendMaterial fill:transparent,stroke:none  
       style LegendSignal fill:transparent,stroke:none  
       style L1 fill:transparent,stroke:none  
       style L2 fill:transparent,stroke:none  
       style L3 fill:transparent,stroke:none  
   end  
   \- The main graph section should contain subgraph Main, with the core functionality as a black box entity, all input nodes starting with B and named in numerical order, and all output nodes starting with E and named in numerical order. The format is as follows:  
   subgraph Main  
       direction LR  
       %% Input signal  
       B1\[ \] \-- x \--\> A\[core function\]  
       B2\[ \] \-. x . \-\> A  
       B3\[ \] \== x \==\> A

       %% Output signals  
       A \-. x . \-\> E1\[ \]  
       A \== x \==\> E2\[ \]

       %% Hide input and output nodes  
       style B1 fill:transparent,stroke:none  
       style B2 fill:transparent,stroke:none  
       style B3 fill:transparent,stroke:none  
       style E1 fill:transparent,stroke:none  
       style E2 fill:transparent,stroke:none  
   end  
5\. \*\*VALIDATION AND SUMMARY\*\*: Verify that the flow diagram accurately describes the functional black box of the system, making sure that the types, paths, and target modules for each flow are clearly identified.

\[Example\]  
\#\# Description of Core Functions  
\-Basketball Return Device: directs the movement of the basketball to the shooter's position

\#\# Examples of functional modules  
1\. \*\*Conversion function of an electric motor\*\*  
   \- Input: electric energy → Function module: electric motor → Output: rotational energy  
2\. \*\* Energy storage function of a linear coil spring  
   \- Input: translational energy → Function module: linear coil spring → Output: stored potential energy

\[Output\]  
\- Draw the flow chart using the markdown-mermaid format and exit the markdown-mermaid format when you are finished.  
\- The chart should be structured as follows: Input flows through energy, matter, and signals to the original entity, and then through energy, matter, and signals to the output.  
\- Please name the original entities in general terms, reflecting the key functions of the project, using standardized expressions from \[Knowledge\].  
\- The content of the above mapping should come from the conclusions of the thinking in the \[Thought\] phase.

\#\#\# Steps to perform a Functional Structure Decomposition Logic Analysis  
\#\#\# 0\. Read the judgment results  
\- \*\*Steps\*\*:  
  \- Read the result of the functional structure analysis check in \[Response\]:  
      \- If the result is none, it means it is the first time to perform the logical analysis, so you can proceed directly to the subsequent steps.  
      \- If the result is reject, it means that you have already executed the logic analysis but failed the logic check, you need to carefully analyze the reasons for rejecting the functional structure analysis and the modification suggestions, and re-execute the subsequent steps.

\#\#\# 1\. Describe the specific function  
\- \*\*Steps\*\*:  
  \- Based on the design mission statement in \[Background\], understand the functional black box diagram and identify the core tasks that the system needs to perform.  
  \- Decompose each core task to identify specific actions or operational steps that the system needs to perform. These actions should be concrete behaviors that enable a specific function, not abstract descriptions.  
  \- Briefly describe each specific function in everyday terms to ensure that each function is an action that can be performed.  
  \- Determining the specific details of the function requires thinking outside the box, covering multiple usage scenarios, and carefully analyzing all processes.

\- \*\*Example\*\*:  
  \- FUNCTION: Use a pencil lead to make a mark on paper  
  \- DESCRIPTION: Move pencil to appropriate area of paper \-\> Apply sufficient, but not overwhelming, force to pencil to move it through specific motions to form a mark on the paper \-\> Lift and lower pencil to touch paper at appropriate time

\#\#\# 2\. Standardized verbal expressions  
\- \*\*Steps\*\*:  
  \- Use the 'Standard Functions and their Basic Functions' formulation in \[Knowledge\] to re-normalize the everyday language formulation in \[1. Describe Specific Functions\].  
  \- Determine the formulation for each function block to ensure that the description conforms to the standardized language, and that each function block should correspond to nodes, named beginning with \`F\` and in numerical order (e.g., \`F1\`, \`F2\`, etc.).

\#\#\# 3\. Inheriting input and output streams  
\- \*\*Step\*\*:  
  \- Inherit all input and output flows from the functional black box diagram. These flows include energy, material and information flows, and they need to be represented in the decomposed functional structure diagram.  
  \- For each input flow, name its starting node beginning with \`B\` and arrange it in numerical order (e.g., \`B1\`, \`B2\`, etc.). For each output stream, name its end node beginning with \`E\` and arrange them in numerical order (e.g., \`E1\`, \`E2\`, etc.).  
  \- Nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and in numerical order will be hidden in the format “style X fill:transparent,stroke:none”, where X is the hidden node, which should cover all the nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and in numerical order. nodes, with a new line of formatting instructions for each node.

\#\#\# 4\. Arranging Function Blocks and Flows  
\- \*\*Steps\*\*:  
  \- Arrange the functional blocks in the functional structure diagram according to the logical order in which the system functions will be performed, ensuring that the sequence accomplishes the intended function of the system.  
  \- Add the input and output flows from the functional black-box diagram to the functional structure diagram, and rationally assign these flows to the corresponding steps by means of specific functional blocks in the functional decomposition steps.  
  \- Assign the corresponding flows (energy flow, material flow, information flow) to each functional block and label them according to the following format:  
     \- Energy flows are represented by solid arrows in the format \`A \-- x \--\> B\`, where x is the specific energy (required).  
     \- Material flows are represented by dashed arrows in the format \`A \- . x . \-\> B\`, where x is the specific substance (required).  
     \- Information flows are represented by another dashed arrow in the format \`A \== x \==\> B\`, where x is the specific information (required).  
     \- Particular care is taken not to have a mishmash of formats for multiple streams, e.g. \`A \-- x . \-\> B\` is a typical error.  
  \- Multiple streams can occur between two function blocks, e.g. you can write both \`A \-- x1 \--\> B\` and \`A \-. x2 . \-\> B\`.  
  \- Make sure that these flows are represented in the functional decomposition diagram and are consistent with the inputs and outputs of the functional black box diagram.

\#\#\# 5\. Logic Validation  
\- \*\*Step\*\*:  
  \- After the functional structure decomposition is complete, revisit the logical order of the overall diagram to ensure that all functional blocks, flows, and connection paths are logical and consistent.  
  \- Ensure that the overall design of the functional structure diagram correctly inherits the input and output flows from the functional black box diagram, and that all necessary nodes and flows have been handled appropriately.

\[Output\]  
Based on the thinking in \[Thought\], output a functional structure decomposition diagram using markdown-mermaid format.

\[Thought\]  
1\. review each function block to determine if any other streams are essential to the function's realization, based on the design task statement in \[Background\].  
2\. check that all functional blocks are effectively connected, and that the flows in the diagram are capable of realizing the complete process from inputs to outputs, and that all functional blocks can only be connected to each other by material, information, or energy flows.  
3\. check that each behavior corresponds to a functional block (node), and do not include behaviors in material, information, or energy flows.  
4\. check that the material flow, information flow or energy flow contains and only contains the term flow, and does not contain actions or behaviors.  
5\. check that there are no direct connections between nodes in the material flow, information flow, or energy flow, and that there are no states in which the nouns of the flow appear, e.g., “A \--\> F1 \[Initiate Autonomous Flight System\]” does not have any information related to the material flow in the connection state.  
6\. check that the connections between the nodes are sufficient; it is not necessary that only one of the material, information or energy flows appear before two nodes, and there can be more than one flow of the same kind.  
7\. Check that these streams correspond to the inputs and outputs of the functional black box diagram in \[Background\], the initial inputs to the system should be driven by the inputs of the functional black box diagram, and the final outputs should correspond to the outputs of the functional black box diagram.  
8\. check the format of all nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and in numerical order should be '\[ \]' in content, e.g. “E1\[ \]”.  
9\. check the formatting of all (nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and in numerical order) should have the formatting code hidden from view at the end of the mermaid statement, e.g. “style B1 fill:transparent,stroke:none”.  
10\. Check the formatting of all non-nodes (nodes starting with \`B\` or \`E\` and in numerical order), there should be no hidden formatting code at the end of the mermaid statement, e.g. “style B1 fill:transparent,stroke:none”.  
11\. Check the mermaid syntax to ensure that it renders correctly and that the connection needs to fulfill the following format:  
     \- Energy flows are represented by solid arrows in the format \`A \-- x \--\> B\`, where x is the specific energy (required).  
     \- Material flows are represented by dashed arrows in the format \`A \- . x . \-\> B\`, where x is the specific substance (required).  
     \- Information flows are represented by another dashed arrow in the format \`A \== x \==\> B\`, where x is the specific information (required).  
     \- Particular care is taken not to have a mishmash of formats for multiple streams, e.g. \`A \-- x . \-\> B\` is a typical error.  
12\. Check that Mian and Legend graphs are kept separate, and that nodes starting with \`L\` and in numerical order do not appear in the Mian graph.

\[Output\]  
\- First output the judgment result, the format of the output is: $Judgment result: \<pass\>/\<reject\> (choose one or the other) $  
   \- If the logic of the judgment after \[Thought\] is sound and complete, you should return \<pass\>.  
   \- If the logic of the judgment after \[Thought\] is unreasonable or incomplete, you should first return \<reject\>.  
\- After that, you should continue to output the reasons for rejection and modifications with the identifiers $rejects and modifications$ at the beginning and end of the paragraph.  
   \- If the result is \<pass\>, you should return “passed”.  
   \- If the result is \<reject\>, you should return the reason for rejection and the modification.

Note: You need to go through the whole process from \[Target\] to \[Background\] to \[Knowledge\] to \[Thought\] to \[Output\], just output the \[Thought\] and \[Output\] parts.

Text Content Extraction  
You need to extract the results of the logical checking of the functional structure in its entirety, including both the $judgment result$ and the $reject reason and modification$:  
\- For the judgment result, there is an identifier like $Judgment result: $, if you can't find the identifier, the final output field will be pass or reject according to your understanding.  
\- For reasons for rejection and modifications, there are identifiers $rejection reasons and modifications$ at the beginning and end of the paragraph, if you can't find the identifiers, the final output field is reasons for rejection and modifications, according to your understanding.

Merging Function Modules  
You will need to be an experienced engineer to review the results of the functional decomposition drawing provided below, rationalize the merging of similar functional modules from a design and manufacturing perspective, and finalize all the modules required for the entire system.

\[Background\]  
Design Requirement.  
{{requirement}}

\[Process\]  
You need to perform the following steps in order:  
1\. \*\*Merge similar functionality\*\*: Identify and merge modules that are functionally similar or duplicated to reduce the number of modules and improve system integration.  
2\. \*\*Adding Missing Functionality\*\*: Compare the contents of the Design Task Sheet in \[Background\], add missing functionality, and re-merge.  
3\. \*\*Module Division and Definition\*\*: Based on the requirements of engineering development, merge and supplement the functional modules to make them conform to the subsystem division of the actual project. Each module should be defined as an independent, deliverable subsystem or component that can be subcontracted for development or procurement in the actual project.  
4\. \*\*Define module function\*\*: Ensure that the function of each module is clearly defined, has practical engineering significance, and can be directly mapped to a specific technical implementation or hardware development.  
5\. \*\*Define Inputs and Outputs\*\*: Define for each module its inputs and outputs, covering material, energy and information flows. The inputs and outputs should reflect the actual role of the module in the system and support subsequent integration and testing.  
6\. \*\*Engineering Feature Emphasis\*\*: Engineering features, such as redundant design, security, scalability, etc., should be reflected in the module descriptions to ensure that the design is able to cope with actual engineering challenges.  
7\. \*\*Table summary\*\*: Instead of drawing mermaid images and focusing on the textual summary and logical confirmation of the module, you need to create a table to summarize the information, including five columns of information: “Module, Functional Description Inputs, Outputs, and Engineering Features”. Note that the identifier \<functional module summary\> is required before and after the output table summary to facilitate subsequent text extraction.

Please note:  
\- The merging of modules should be based on functional similarity, logical order, and overall system efficiency and realizability.  
\- When identifying module inputs and outputs, ensure that the inputs and outputs of each module correspond to the flows in the functional decomposition drawing.  
\- If the inputs or outputs of certain modules are represented in more than one functional block, consider them together and define them in the most appropriate module.

Merge Function \- Text Content Extraction  
You need to extract the summary form for the function module in its entirety:  
\- The summary form for the function module is at the back of the text, with identifiers \<function module summary\> at the beginning and end of the form, if you can't find the identifiers, then the final output field is the final function module summary form, as you understand it.

User Selection  
\- If you are not satisfied, you can redo \[Function Block Generation\].  
\- If you are satisfied, you can proceed with the conceptual optimization of the function block. Please use \[Morphological Matrix\] first to confirm the implementation plan of the function block.
